<h2 id="sjto">SOCIAL JUSTICE TRIBUNALS ONTARIO</h2>

<h3 id="sjto-1">Executive Chair's Message</h3>

<p><em><strong>Michael Gottheil, Executive Chair</strong>
<br>Social Justice Tribunals Ontario</em></p>

<p>I am pleased to present the 2011-2012 annual report of Social Justice Tribunals
Ontario (SJTO). Our 2010-2011 annual report, which covered only the three
months from our inception in January 2011 to the end of that fiscal year, was
necessarily long on intentions, but short on specific actions and achievements in
building the new organization. I believe we have made remarkable strides in the
past 12 months.</p>
<p>It is worth commenting once again that the concept of "clustering" is unique to
Ontario. While there is a trend in a number of jurisdictions worldwide to restructure
the administrative justice sector, generally through tribunal amalgamation,
clustering brings together previously separate tribunals into a single organization,
but maintains the statutory mandate and membership of each. This permits us to
ensure that subject area expertise and specialized case resolution processes
remain as fundamental principles of administrative justice, while providing the base
to achieve both resource efficiencies and indeed strengthen the overall capacity,
diversity and effectiveness of the organization.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the efficiencies, and the depth and breadth of the skills,
experience and organizational capacity that flow from clustering, takes reflecting,
planning and transforming. And, in the context of the SJTO, which provides critical
services to the public, it also means ensuring that we continue to meet our
mandates on a daily basis. Over the past year we have undertaken a number of
initiatives.</p>
<p>For example, we completed an extensive strategic planning exercise that will guide
our continuing transformation and, in doing so, we developed a vision for that
transformation: <em>To redefine/redesign previously distinct individual tribunals into a
single, integrated administrative justice organization, with recognizable component
parts based, at least in part, on the original tribunals.</em> We also developed a
Mandate, Mission and Values statements that provide unifying themes for our
development.</p>
<p>On the adjudicative front, we have started to reap the benefits of clustering,
especially in the more effective use of resources. Some tribunals, for example,
which previously had to rent accommodation in hotels in locations where they had
no hearing rooms, are now sharing hearing rooms, and in some cases
administrative staff, thus making more prudent and responsible use of public
resources while providing parties with better, more reliable service.</p>
<p>This would not have been possible, of course, without the work of our staff, who
have risen to the challenges inherent in our transition. I especially appreciate the
work of our regional staff in starting to implement our regional presence.</p>
<p>Another of the real benefits of our cluster is that it creates the opportunity for us to
share not only resources, but also our adjudicative approaches, subject area
expertise, our experiences, perspectives and backgrounds. While each tribunal
deals with cases under a specific statute, the social, economic and human context
of the disputes that come before us, and the impact of our decisions, are often
interconnected. The law may compartmentalize issues, but the challenges that
face individuals are not generally so easily dissected. For example, individuals may
be at the LTB facing eviction because they have lost their job and are awaiting an
SBT ruling on benefits, or because of a dispute with a fellow tenant related to
mental health issues. A student may be facing expulsion from school because
incidents of bullying related to race or sexual orientation have boiled over.
Providing the opportunity for SJTO adjudicators and staff to share their respective
skills, experience and backgrounds will surely allow us to provide fairer, more just
and more timely dispute resolution.</p>
<p>Change of this scope is bound to raise questions among stakeholders, and so I,
along with the Associate Chairs, have been making a concentrated effort to speak
with both our traditional stakeholders and with others who may have an interest in
more than one of our tribunals, such as, for example, a presentation to the
Northern Region Legal Clinic training conference. We have formalized a
consultation policy, and we will be further developing our points of contact with the
community in the coming year.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to thank the Associate Chairs of each of the tribunals for their
ongoing support during the year, and their contributions both with SJTO and in the
broader adjudicative tribunal community, which clearly recognizes our leaderhip's
expertise. For example, Gary Yee chaired last year's annual conference of the
Council of Canadian Adjudicative Tribunals and spearheaded the development of
our Professional Development Institute; Suzanne Gilbert headed up the SJTO
strategic planning project and will be taking on our French Language Services
initiative; Lilian Ma, recognized by the Federation of Asian Canadian Lawyers,
continues to be deeply involved in the work of the Society of Ontario Adjudicators
and Regulators; David Wright took on the important role of heading up our Rules
Committee and continues to present regularly at Ontario Bar Association and other
conferences.</p>
<p>All of this demonstrates, I believe, that SJTO is well on its way to fulfilling its
mission and mandate, and in doing so, demonstrating our commitment to providing
a consistent, accessible and positive face to justice in Ontario.</p>

<h3 id="sjto-2">Legislative Authority</h3>
<p>Social Justice Tribunals Ontario (SJTO) is established under the authority of the
<em>Adjudicative Tribunals Accountability, Governance and Appointments Act, 2009</em>
(the Tribunals Act). The creation of SJTO is part of the government's ongoing
efforts to ensure adjudicative tribunals best serve the public by being accountable,
transparent and efficient in their operations, and independent in their decision
making functions.</p>
<p>The government announced its intention to form a social justice tribunals cluster in
August 2010 and passed the necessary regulation on January 25, 2011, bringing
together the Child and Family Services Review Board, Custody Review Board,
Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario, Landlord and Tenant Board, the Ontario Special
Education (English) Tribunal, the Ontario Special Education (French) Tribunal, and
the Social Benefits Tribunal. Michael Gottheil was appointed Executive Chair on
March 7.</p>
<p>Section 15 of the Tribunals Act states that the government may designate a cluster
when "<em>the matters that the tribunals deal with are such that they can operate more
effectively and efficiently as part of a cluster than alone.</em>"</p>
<p>In addition to the broad goal of achieving effectiveness and efficiency, the Act
requires that the cluster develop, as one of several public accountability
documents, a mandate and mission statement. The SJTO Mandate, Mission and
Values statement appears elsewhere in this report.</p>
<p>The Tribunals Act also requires a cluster to develop a consultation policy, a service
standard policy and a membership accountability framework. These documents
were prepared and presented for approval to the Attorney General prior to the April
1, 2012 deadline. The cluster also developed, as required, an ethics plan, which
must be approved by the province's Conflict of Interest Commissioner.</p>
<p>In addition, SJTO is subject to policies of the Management Board of Cabinet,
which, for example, require SJTO to develop an accessibility plan, provide annual
business plans and annual reports, and comply with other regulations that ensure
public accountability within a framework of adjudicative independence.</p>
<p>More information about the development of the accountability documents is found
in the following sections.</p>

<h3 id="sjto-3">Operational Highlights</h3>
<h4 id="sjto-4">Creating the new organization</h4>
<p>The start of SJTO's first full fiscal year was marked by the transfer of financial
responsibility for the constituent tribunals, including staff and Members, to the
Ministry of the Attorney General.</p>
<p>Bringing together seven adjudicative tribunals into a single organization presents
many opportunities to improve effectiveness and efficiency, but it also has its share
of challenges. It requires a long term strategic vision to guide the many short term
operational decisions required to ensure a successful transition.
Work began on creating the new organizational structure for SJTO to guide the
transition, and at the end of June, the cluster announced several important
initiatives, which have since been completed. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Appointing an <em>Executive Lead</em> to oversee the administration of all SJTO
operations and, working with the Executive Chair, providing strategic
leadership, executive oversight, and leading the transformation towards a
unified organization.</li>
<li>Forming a new <em>Strategic Business Services Branch</em>, to bring together
corporate services and align administrative and operational resources. This
limits duplication of corporate services across tribunals (e.g. finance,
business planning) and allows for greater consistency in corporate service
standards.</li>
<li>Creating a new <em>Legal Services Unit</em> to allow more effective use of legal resources.</li>
<li>Establishing a <em>Corporate Communications Unit</em> to oversee external and
internal communications, provide issues management advice, and support
outreach and stakeholder engagement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adjudication and dispute resolution are SJTO's core businesses, and to more
efficiently support these activities, the transitional structure reorganized the case
management functions of the constituent tribunals. The Social Benefits Tribunal,
the Child and Family Services Review Board, the Custody Review Board and the
English and French Ontario Special Education Tribunals now share the case
management function, while the Landlord and Tenant Board and Human Rights
Tribunal of Ontario continue to administer their own systems. Further changes in
this structure are expected as the cluster's final organization takes shape.</p>

<h4 id="sjto-5">Strategic Planning</h4>
<p>With these foundation pieces in place, the next step involved developing a
strategic transformation plan. The Executive Chair, Associate Chairs and senior
management team spent two days in October developing a shared understanding
and discussing the components of the plan, along with examining their individual
roles and responsibilities. Out of that work came a clear transformation objective: <em>To redefine/redesign previously distinct individual tribunals into a single, integrated
administrative justice organization, with recognizable component parts based, at
least in part, on the original tribunals.</em></p>
<p>It was also agreed that the guiding principles of clustering and the internal
organizational design of the cluster, would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>the needs of SJTO's users and the broader public</li>
<li>the desire to enhance efficiency, subject matter effectiveness and expertise, and access to justice;</li>
<li>the desire to provide a common and positive face of justice to the public</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="sjto-6">Governance and Accountability Documents</h4>
<p>While this work was proceeding, SJTO also turned its attention to developing the
policy documents required by the Tribunals Act and regulations. Under the
direction of the Executive Chair, SJTO formed working groups of Members and
staff to develop:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>Consultation Policy</strong> to govern procedures for consulting with the public
when SJTO is considering changes to its rules/policies, including
consultation with stakeholders who would be affected by the changes.</li>
<li><strong>Service Standards</strong>, to provide common metrics for all the tribunals,
although the precise standards may differ.</li>
<li>A <strong>Complaints Process</strong> for making, reviewing and responding to complaints
about the service provided by the SJTO and its constituent tribunals.</li>
<li>An <strong>Ethics Plan</strong>, to submit to the Conflict of Interest Commissioner for
approval.</li>
<li>A <strong>Member Accountability Framework</strong>, to develop position descriptions for
members, including the skills, knowledge, experience, other attributes and
specific qualifications required of a person to be appointed as a member.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these documents were completed and submitted as required by the April 1,
2012, deadline.</p>

<h4 id="sjto-7">French Language Services</h4>
<p>SJTO tribunals provide services to the public in both official languages in
accordance with the French Language Services Act (FLSA). Regional offices in
areas designated by the FLSA have bilingual staff available.</p>

<h4 id="sjto-8">Accessibility and Mental Health</h4>
<p>One of SJTO's core values is a commitment to access to justice, diversity and
inclusion, and as part of its efforts in this area, it has formed a Capacity, Mental
Health and Access Working Group to build on initiatives developed by several of
SJTO tribunals. Experience suggests that a significant number of those who
appear before SJTO's constituent tribunals have mental health or capacity issues,
and therefore may face barriers in their ability to participate effectively in our
proceedings. While SJTO tribunals already have policies relating to accessibility
and accommodation, and conduct professional development training relating to
those issues, the working group will go beyond the traditional approaches and
seek ways of further enhancing access.</p>

<h4 id="sjto-9">Professional Development</h4>
<p>To take advantage of the diversity inherent in SJTO's constituent tribunals, SJTO
is planning its first Professional Development Institute for early in the new fiscal
year. This will, for the first time, bring together all of SJTO's almost 200 full- and
part-time Members in a symposium stretching over three days of training, capacity
building, and improving the SJTO's substantive and process abilities. It will also
provide opportunities to gain a richer understanding and a better appreciation of
the diversity of the community that SJTO serves.</p>

<h2 id="cfsrb-crb">CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES REVIEW BOARD / CUSTODY REVIEW BOARD</h2>

<h3 id="cfsrb-crb-1">Associate Chair's Message</h3>

<p><em><strong>Suzanne Gilbert, Associate Chair</strong>
<br>Child and Family Services Review Board/Custody Review Board</em></p>

<p>I am pleased to present the 2011-2012 Annual Report of the Child and Family
Services Review Board (CFSRB) and Custody Review Board (CRB). As
anticipated, this year was one of change as we embarked on the major
transformation brought about by the creation of Social Justice Tribunals Ontario.
The highlight of this year is certainly the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in
<em>The Children's Aid Society of Waterloo v. D.D.(2011 ONCA 441)</em> and the decision
of the Supreme Court of Canada to deny the appeal of the Children's Aid Society
of Waterloo. The Court of Appeal confirmed the Board's interpretation regarding
its jurisdiction under section 68.1 of the <em>Child and Family Services Act (CFSA)</em> for
service delivery complaints against children's aid societies.</p>
<p>The Board also analysed the overall situation regarding the access of children in
care to their right to a review of their residential placement and started to discuss
the accessibility of the Board for Aboriginal children and their families. These
issues will continue to be discussed during the next fiscal year.</p>
<p>During the year, the Board had to deal with parties breaching the confidentiality of
Board proceedings. To address this issue, the Board established standardized
confidentiality orders at hearings and in its decisions.</p>
<p>The settlement facilitation program has proven again this year to be useful to the
parties involved in complaints regarding services provided by children's aid
societies. Settlement agreements were reached in 82 per cent of the files
scheduled for settlement facilitation, which is the same as last year.</p>
<p>The Board provided training again this year for Board members, holding
teleconferences on subjects including settlement facilitation and CRB case law
review.</p>
<p>I want to thank all Board members and staff who continue to maintain the high
quality in their work and continue to provide significant contributions to SJTO.
I cannot conclude my message without mentioning the loss of our dear friend and
colleague Greg Price, who passed away in September 2011. He was a
tremendous support for his colleagues and me. He was professional,
knowledgeable and always ready to help. He is missed and will be remembered.</p>

<h3 id="cfsrb-crb-2">Legislative Authority</h3>
<h4 id="cfsrb-crb-3">The Child and Family Services Review Board</h4>
<p>Under the <em>Child and Family Services Act (CFSA)</em>, the CFSRB is mandated to review:</p>
<ul>
<li>Residential placements of children in care pursuant to section 36</li>
<li>A children's aid society decision to remove a Crown ward, where the child has
resided continuously with the foster parent for two years or more, pursuant to section 61</li>
<li>Certain client complaints related to children's aid societies pursuant to sections 68 and 68.1</li>
<li>Emergency admission of a child to a secure treatment program pursuant to section 124</li>
<li>A Director's decision to refuse to approve a proposed adoption placement, or to
impose a term or condition on an approval, pursuant to section 142</li>
<li>A decision of a children's aid society to refuse an application to adopt a
particular child, or a decision of a society or licensee to remove a child from an
adoption placement, pursuant to section144.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the <em>Education Act</em>, the Board hears appeals of:</p>
<ul>
<li>School Board expulsion decisions pursuant to section 311.7.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the <em>Intercountry Adoption Act</em>, the Board reviews:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Director's refusal to approve a person as eligible and suitable to adopt for the
purpose of an intercountry adoption, or the attachment of conditions to a
Director's approval, pursuant to section 5</li>
<li>A Director's refusal to approve a proposed intercountry adoption, or the
attachment of conditions to a Director's approval, pursuant to section 6.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="cfsrb-crb-4">Custody Review Board</h4>
<p>Under section 97(1) of the <em>Child and Family Services Act</em>, the Custody Review
Board hears applications and makes recommendations to Provincial Directors who
make decisions with respect to youth in custody regarding:</p>
<ul>
<li>A particular placement where a young person is being held or to which the young person has been transferred</li>
<li>A Provincial Director's refusal to authorize the young person's temporary release or reintegration leave</li>
<li>The young person's transfer from a place of open custody to a place of secure custody</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cfsrb-crb-5">Operational Highlights</h3>
<h4 id="cfsrb-crb-6">Court of Appeal Decsion</h4>
<p>When the Ontario Court of Appeal issued its decision in <em>The Children's Aid Society
of Waterloo v. D.D.</em>, the Board proceeded with files it had placed on hold pending
the appeal. The Board adjusted its regular scheduling practice and managed to
quickly schedule those files and bring most of them to completion.
There were 60 applications at various stages of the hearing process on hold when
the Court of Appeal for Ontario issued its decision. Of the 60 applications, 22
applications were closed either because they were withdrawn or the Board was
unable to contact the applicant. The Board successfully completed the scheduling
of 38 applications by September 2011.</p>

<h4 id="cfsrb-crb-7">CRB - Background Documents</h4>
<p>In June 2011, the CRB started an initiative to improve the quality of the review
process of new CRB applications. The Board now obtains supporting
documentation following receipt of the application, including custody/detention
documents, pre-sentence reports and/or the latest level of detention review. This
practice will allow Board members to get accurate and more in-depth information
for conducting the review and for reference in the Board's recommendation.</p>

<h3 id="cfsrb-crb-8">Statistics/Commentary</h3>
<p>In the 2011-2012 fiscal year, the CFSRB received 300 applications and the CRB
received 169 applications for a total of 469 applications, a slight decrease from the
previous year. The following chart provides a summary of Boards' caseloads for
the last three fiscal years:</p>

<p>The Board dealt with two unusual issues in the context of section 61 hearings:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the first case, it heard a motion relating to mootness and a motion to state
a case for contempt in a case involving foster parents seeking the return of
their foster child. The Board ultimately dismissed the case for mootness after the society obtained a final restraining order preventing the foster
parents from having contact with the child. The Board found that there was
no point in going ahead with a case in which the applicants could not have
the child returned to them because of the Court's final restraining order.</li>
<li>In the second case, the society alleged that if the foster home had already
been closed, the Board could not proceed to hear the application. The
Board dismissed the argument and decided that it had jurisdiction because
the application for review was filed on time and the legislation places no
limits on the Board's authority to review a proposed removal in the face of a
foster home closing. The decision determined that societies can not
unilaterally take themselves outside of the scope of s. 61 by "closing" foster
homes. The Board fulfils its legislated mandate by conducting the review
and determining the action that is in the best interests of the child. The
parties must then take the necessary steps to comply with the order.</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p>The number of applications withdrawn may be explained by the fact that some
applicants whose files have been placed on hold because of the appeal in <em>The
Children's Aid Society of Waterloo v. D.D. (2011 ONCA 441)</em> did not wish to
proceed with their applications.</p>
<p>The Board also released a decision determining that grandparents who had
approached a society to become the kin placement for their grandchildren were
seeking a service from the society and were entitled to reasons under section 68.1
(4) 5 of the <em>Act</em> when the society refused their request.</p>

<br>

<p>The increase in the number of applications scheduled for a settlement facilitation
conference is in part because of the scheduling of files put on hold waiting for the
Court of Appeal decision. The settlement facilitation program continues to be a success considering the high level of settlements, which is again this year at 82 per cent. The Board trained four new members to do settlement facilitation.</p>

<p>In one of its decisions, the Board analyzed the circumstances that must exist for it
to be determined that a society had received an application to adopt. The society
had placed a child for adoption with a family without informing the applicants that
their application for adoption had been refused, and that they had the right to ask
for a review of that decision. The Board decided that the child's placement was not
valid, as the application to adopt was received by the society before it had placed
the child.</p>

<br>

<p>The Office of the Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth has started
supporting children in their efforts to request a review of their placement to the
Board, resulting in more applications this year.</p>
<p>The Board dealt with the issue of whether the child's placement was a youth justice
placement or a child welfare placement. A youth justice placement cannot be reviewed by the Board. In one case, the Board found that the placement came
under a youth justice order to live at the facility, while in another case, the Board
found that the child's placement was a placement by a society and not by the youth
court. The evidence in those cases revolved around the wording and intent of the
Youth Court orders.</p>
<p>The Board also developed and used a comprehensive framework for reviewing
residential placements under section 36 of the Act. The Board incorporated in its
analysis the relevant factors from the best interests test as described in the CFSA
and from the factors that a Residential Placement Advisory Committee must
consider when it reviews a child's placement.</p>

<p>The majority of applications received for Emergency Secure Treatment Admission
continued to be from children admitted to Youthdale Treatment Centres. The
Board received three applications from children admitted to Syl Apps Youth
Centre. There were no applications relating to admissions to Roberts/Smart
Centre.</p>
<p>The Board continued to rule that it is the facility's burden of evidence to prove the
conditions for the child's admission. It is for the facility to call the psychiatrist about
the opinion evidence supporting the admission.</p>
<p>The Board has decided that to be fair to the child who has lost his or her freedom,
the child needs to have the option of questioning the opinion leading to the
admission in a secure treatment facility. Therefore, documents containing the
psychiatrist's opinion are not admissible unless the psychiatrist is made available
for cross-examination or the child consents.</p>

a recommendation that they be moved closer to home. Reasons for moves away
from the home community included bed shortages and restructuring of facilities.
Youth with significant mental health and learning needs continued to seek
placements with additional supports. The Board's easier access to pre-sentence
reports and other background documents has enhanced the Board's ability to
make its needs-based recommendations.</p>

<h2 id="hrto">HUMAN RIGHTS TRIBUNAL OF ONTARIO</h2>

<h3 id="hrto-1">Associate Chair's Message</h3>

<p><em><strong>David A. Wright, Associate Chair</strong>
<br>Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario</em></p>

<p>This annual report marks nearly four years since the HRTO took on its new
mandate of receiving and processing applications filed directly with it under the
<em>Human Rights Code</em>. Following major changes to our process in mid-2010 and the
appointment of new vice-chairs and members in 2011, the HRTO made significant
strides in reducing our active caseload. In 2011-12 we resolved more applications
than were filed and dramatically reduced the number of cases waiting to be
scheduled. By the end of the year, we were on track to achieve major reductions in
the waiting time for mediations and hearings and overall case processing times in
2012-13.</p>
<p>This fiscal year also saw our work nearly completed on transition cases originally
filed with the Ontario Human Rights Commission. This was achieved through the
hard work of a dedicated group of staff and adjudicators, and this milestone allows
us to focus almost exclusively on directly filed applications.</p>
<p>This year we continued the development of the rich body of substantive and
procedural jurisprudence under the new <em>Human Rights Code</em>. I am proud of the
quality of the decisions written by our adjudicators, which not only resolve the
dispute between the parties but also often clarify the law and thereby avoid
litigation in other circumstances.</p>
<p>Adjudication of cases on their merits is only part of the HRTO's work. Mediations
and mediation-adjudications conducted by Tribunal members resulted in the
settlement of well over a thousand cases. Active triage when applications are filed
and case management throughout the process allow us to tailor our procedures to
particular cases, and constitute a considerable portion of the work of staff and
adjudicators.</p>
<p>I commend our staff and adjudicators for their hard work in a particularly busy year
and their ongoing dedication to serving the people of Ontario.</p>

<h3 id="hrto-2">Legislative Authority</h3>
<p>The HRTO is established under the Ontario <em>Human Rights Code</em>. Since June
2008, all claims of discrimination under the <em>Code</em> are dealt with through
applications filed directly with the HRTO. The HRTO's primary role is to provide an
expeditious and accessible process for resolving those applications through
voluntary mediation or, where the dispute is not resolved through mediation, a
hearing and an enforceable decision.</p>

<h3 id="hrto-3">Operational Highlights</h3>
<h4 id="hrto-4">Caseload management</h4>
<p>The HRTO made significant progress on reducing its active caseload. Through a
number of measures, including a scheduling blitz, the HRTO was able to close 624
more cases than were opened in fiscal 2011-2012. This brought the number of
open cases to 3,302 at fiscal year-end, approximately 400 of which were deferred
pending the outcome of some other proceeding outside the HRTO. The number of
cases waiting to be scheduled for mediation and hearings was also dramatically
reduced during fiscal 2011-2012.</p>
<p>The HRTO also continued to work on the timeliness of its processes, consistent
with principles of fairness and other core values. Of the cases closed in fiscal
2011-2012 where the application was accepted, 1,439 (55 per cent) were closed
within one year. The average time from application acceptance to closure was 387
days, with a median of 324 days. However, a large number of files - 767 - were
closed that did not reach the application acceptance stage because they were
resolved on some preliminary basis, including the new Summary Hearing process.
The HRTO currently does not have timeline measures for these 767 closures, but
many of them were resolved within one year.</p>

<h4 id="hrto-5">Transitional Applications and Commission Referred Complaints</h4>
<p>June 2008 amendments to the Code established the new human rights system and
included a mechanism for dealing with complaints still pending at the Ontario
Human Rights Commission. For a period of one year, the complainant could bring
the complaint to the HRTO by filing an application under section 53 of the Code.
The HRTO received almost 2,000 such applications. By the end of this fiscal year,
all but 85 had been resolved, with most of those cases nearing completion.</p>
<p>As well, the Commission continued to refer complaints to the HRTO until
December 31, 2008. Most of these claims have been resolved. At the end of this
fiscal year, there were only 16 active cases, some of which involve a number of
related files involving similar issues.</p>

<h3 id="hrto-6">Statistics/Commentary</h3>
<p>The following statistics refer only to "New Applications" made under section 34 of
the <em>Code</em>, not Transitional Applications or Commission Referred Complaints.</p>

<p>The following chart shows the percentage of applications based on each of the five

discrimination in respect of one social area, some are based on more than one, so
the total exceeds 100 per cent by a small amount.</p>

<h2 id="ltb">LANDLORD AND TENANT BOARD</h2>

<h3 id="ltb-1">Associate Chair's Message</h3>

<p><em><strong>Lilian Ma, Associate Chair &emsp; Alternate Executive Chair</strong>
<br>Landlord and Tenant Board &emsp; Social Justice Tribunals Ontario</em></p>

<p>This has been a busy year at the Board as we focused our efforts on increasing
the efficiency of the Board's scheduling model for hearings. We have made
changes to the way we schedule those application types that make up the bulk of
the LTB's workload, the landlord's application to terminate the tenancy and evict
the tenant because of rent arrears (L1) and to collect rent arrears (L9). The
changes to the scheduling model have freed more time to hear contested/complex
applications that generally take longer to adjudicate, and they have improved our
time to hearing for all applications. For more information, please see the
Operational Highlights section of this report.</p>
<p>I am grateful for the input from Members and staff as well as the Board's regular
"users" at three focus groups held in London, Toronto and Ottawa. The ongoing
dialogue between the Board and its Stakeholder Advisory Committee* also ensures that the views of both landlord and tenant groups are given the necessary attention in the development of procedures, forms, Rules of Practice and Interpretation Guidelines.</p>
<p>The Board's Rules and Guidelines Committee continues to play a valuable role in
amending existing rules of practice and interpretation guidelines, and developing
new ones where the need is identified by Board Members, staff and stakeholders.
The Board's Rules and Guidelines promote consistency in the application of the
legislation and the Board's processes.</p>
<p>I also wish to thank the Board Members and staff who work together as a team in
delivering services to tenants and landlords. In addition to their ongoing
commitment to the effective and efficient operation of the Board, they also provided
valuable input into the Board's new scheduling model. My appreciation and thanks
go to the Board's Vice Chairs, the Director, Case Management/Registrar, Regional
Managers and Managers of Customer Service, as well as the SJTO Legal Services
and Program Development Unit. They all play an important role in the
management, training and policy work they do for the Board.</p>
<p>I look forward to the coming year as the Board undertakes new initiatives to
implement legislative changes with a view to facilitating access to justice for
Ontario landlords and tenants.</p>
<p>* Representatives from the Advocacy Centre for Tenants Ontario (ACTO) and the Federation of
Rental-Housing Providers of Ontario (FRPO) participate in the Stakeholder Advisory Committee.</p>

<h3 id="ltb-2">Legislative Authority</h3>
<p>The Landlord and Tenant Board (LTB) draws its legislative authority from the
<em>Residential Tenancies Act, 2006</em> (the RTA or the Act), which in section 1 sets out
the following purposes for the Board:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide protection for residential tenants from unlawful rent increases and unlawful evictions;</li>
<li>establish a framework for the regulation of residential rent;</li>
<li>balance the rights and responsibilities of residential landlords and tenants; and,</li>
<li>provide for the adjudication of disputes and for other processes to informally resolve disputes.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="ltb-3">Dual Mandate</h4>
<h5>Resolving disputes</h5>
<ul>
<li>Adjudication
	<br>In the Act, section 168(2) provides that the Board has jurisdiction to
	determine all applications under the RTA, while section 174 provides the
	Board with the authority to hear and determine all questions of law and fact
	with respect to all matters within its jurisdiction under the Act.
	Pursuant to section 183 of the Act, the Board strives to provide the most
	expeditious method of determining the questions that arise in a proceeding
	and to provide parties an adequate opportunity to know the issues and to
	be heard on the matter.</li>
<li>Mediation
	<br>Section 194 of the Act allows the Board to mediate disputes, if both parties
	agree to try this approach. Board Mediators are available to meet with
	parties to try to help them reach a workable agreement that is acceptable to
	both sides.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Providing information</h5>
<p>The LTB, under section 177 of the Act, is required to give information to landlords
and tenants about their rights and obligations. It fulfills this mandate through
various means:</p>
<ul>
<li>A virtual Call Centre handles customer inquiries, in both English and
French, through toll free lines. Customer Service Officers are available
during regular business hours. An automated telephone service answers
frequently-asked questions 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This year,
the Board responded to over 500,000 telephone calls.</li>
<li>Eight offices that offer in-person service to clients. At those offices,
landlords and tenants can obtain information from one of the Board's
Customer Service Officers about their rights and obligations under the law,
as well as file applications, attend hearings and participate in mediation.</li>
<li>A bilingual website, <a href="/ltb/">tribunalsontario.ca/ltb</a>, which received approximately 1.2
million hits each month over the past fiscal year. The website provides
access to all Board forms, brochures, Rules of Practice, Interpretation
Guidelines, the Board's complaint procedures and its Policy on Accessibility
and Human Rights.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="ltb-4">Amendments to the RTA</h4>
<p>Effective January 1, 2012, the RTA was amended by Bill 140 as part of the Long
Term Affordable Housing Strategy of the Ministry of Housing.
Section 206.1 was added to the RTA, permitting the Board to designate staff to
hold a hearing and make an order related to an uncontested application or an
application specified in the Board's Rules of Practice. In the coming year the
Board, in consultation with its stakeholders, will consider how implementing this
change might enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the Board's service to its
clients. On January 1, 2013, we anticipate the implementation of other Bill 140
amendments, such as section 189, which will require the Board to serve the notice
of hearing and application to the respondent unless the Board, in the
circumstances set out in its Rules, orders the applicant to do so.</p>


<h3 id="ltb-5">Operational Highlights</h3>
<p>The Landlord and Tenant Board (LTB) is a high-volume tribunal with a mandate to
provide the most expeditious method of determining the questions that arise in a
proceeding and to provide parties an adequate opportunity to know the issues and
be heard on the matter (see section 183 of the <em>Residential Tenancies Act</em>, 2006,
(the RTA).</p>
<p>During the 2011-2012 fiscal year, the Board focused its efforts on improving the
way it schedules landlord applications to terminate a tenancy and evict based on
non-payment of rent and to collect rent arrears, as improvements in this area
would have the greatest impact.</p>

<h4 id="ltb-6">L1/L9 scheduling</h4>
<p>In November 2011, the LTB implemented a new scheduling model to optimize the
use of hearing time and resources with a view to improving service to the landlords
and tenants of Ontario. The new model consists of scheduling L1 and L9
applications on specific days of the week in each regional office. This change has
not been implemented in off-site hearing locations as the number of L1/L9
applications does not generally warrant such an approach. Hearing blocks still
have a mix of application types to ensure equal access for landlord and tenant
applications in off-site locations.</p>
<p>Grouping L1 and L9 applications together in one hearing block has resulted in
more focussed and effective hearings and has led to reduced time to hearing for all
application types, including tenant applications. The Board is also able to schedule
adjourned matters more quickly. Feedback from the Board's stakeholders about
these changes has been positive.</p>

<h4 id="ltb-7">L1/L9 update form</h4>
<p>As part of the scheduling changes the Board introduced during this fiscal year,
landlords or their representatives are now asked to update the status of the L1 or
L9 application in writing, as of the hearing date, and to submit this update to the
presiding Member.</p>
<p>The Board has developed a form for landlords and their representatives to use to
update the information. The <em>L1/L9 - Information Update as of Hearing Day</em> form is
available at all Board offices and in the Other Forms section of the website.</p>

<h4 id="ltb-8">Rules and Guidelines changes</h4>
<p>Effective January 6, 2012, the Board revised a number of its Rules of Practice and
Interpretation Guidelines. As well, one new Rule and two new Guidelines were
released. These new documents are Rule 32, "Legal Representatives Acting as
Advocates and Witnesses in the Same Proceeding"; Interpretation Guideline 20,
"Parties, Agents and Representatives"; and Interpretation Guideline 21, "Landlords,
Tenants, Occupants and Residential Tenancies." All of the Board's Rules and
Guidelines are available on its website.</p>

<h4 id="ltb-9">Public education videos</h4>
<p>The Board has developed five public education videos to make information about
the law and the Board's processes more accessible. These videos are posted on
the Board's website (with voice over and captioning). Captioned versions are also
played in the waiting areas of the Board's offices.</p>

<h3 id="ltb-10">Statistics/Commentary</h3>
<h4>Applications Filed</h4>
<p>From April 1, 2011, to March 31, 2012, the Board received 81,084 applications.
This is an increase of 3,690 applications, or approximately five per cent, compared
to the 2010-2011 caseload.</p>

<h4>Landlord vs Tenant Applications</h4>
<p>The ratio of landlord to tenant applications has remained relatively constant since
1998 when the resolution of landlord-tenant disputes was transferred from the
provincial court system to an adjudicative tribunal. This past year was no
exception, with 91 per cent of applications filed by landlords and 9 per cent filed by
tenants.</p>

<h4>Applications by Type</h4>
<p>Applications for termination of tenancy and eviction continue to represent the bulk
of the Board's workload. Of the total applications received by the Board, 72.2 per
cent were for termination of tenancy because of arrears of rent.
The following table shows the number of each application type filed by landlords
for the 2011-2012 fiscal year and the two previous years. The number in brackets
shows the percentage of the total applications filed by landlords.</p>

<h4>Pending TPA Applications</h4>
<p>At the beginning of the 2011-2012 fiscal year, only three applications that had been
filed under the <em>Tenant Protection Act, 1997</em> (the TPA), were still active. The TPA
was the legislation in effect prior to the implementation of the RTA in 2007. The
Board is responsible for resolving these applications in addition to its RTA
workload. Between April 1, 2011, and March 31, 2012, the Board resolved two
TPA applications, leaving one TPA application awaiting resolution.</p>

<h4>Application Resolution</h4>
<p>For the fiscal year 2011-2012, the Board received 81,084 applications and
resolved 81,032 applications. Some applications may generate more than one
resolution because of the re-opening and review processes. As of March 31, 2012,
the number of unresolved RTA applications is 10,187. This number represents
approximately seven weeks' work at the Board, which is the workload appropriate
to warrant smooth and continuous operation for the Board.</p>
<p>The following table shows the total number of applications received, resolved and
outstanding at the end of the fiscal year, for 2011-2012 and the two previous years.</p>

across regions and also illustrates the regional distribution of applications filed with
the Board.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://tribunalsontario.ca/documents/images/sjto-img-4.png" alt="LTB Regional Activity"></div>

<h4>Review and Appeal Statistics</h4>
<p>A party to an application may ask for a review of a Board order if he or she
believes that the order contains a serious error or that a serious error occurred in
the proceedings, including where a party was not reasonably able to participate in
the proceeding. The authority for requesting a review comes from section 21.2 of
the <em>Statutory Powers Procedure Act</em>, subsection 209(2) of the RTA, and Rule 29 of
the Board's Rules of Practice.</p>
<p>When a review request is filed with the Board, a Member conducts a preliminary
review, without holding a hearing, to determine whether or not the order may
contain a serious error or a serious error may have occurred in the proceedings.
When the Member determines that there is a possibility of a serious error affecting
the result of the case, a review hearing will be held. Otherwise, the Member will
dismiss the request for review.</p>
<p>Over the 2011-2012 fiscal year, the Board received 2,200 requests for review, 2.7
per cent of the total number of applications received. Of the review requests
received, 1,028 (1.26 per cent) were sent to hearing.</p>
<p>Section 210 of the RTA also provides that any person affected by a Board order
may appeal the order to the Divisional Court within 30 days after being given the
order, but only on a question of law. Over the 2011-2012 fiscal year, the Board
received 134 Notices of Appeal of Board orders. This number represents 0.17 per
cent of the total number of applications resolved by the Board.</p>

<h4>Average Processing Times</h4>
<p>The Board tracks the length of time from the date an application is filed to the initial
hearing date that is scheduled, and the length of time from the final hearing date to
the date the order is issued. While most cases are resolved during the initially
scheduled hearing, some require more than one hearing appearance. A number of
factors, such as the availability of parties or their representatives, can affect the
length of time between the initial hearing date and the final hearing date.</p>
<p>The processing times generally correspond to the complexity of the application
types. On average for the 2011-2012 fiscal year, hearings of L1 applications (to
end the tenancy and evict the tenant for rent arrears) were scheduled within 25
business days of the date the applications were filed, and the order issued within
four business days of the final hearing. L5 applications filed by landlords (for
above-guideline rent increases) generally involve the lengthiest processes and as
a result tend to be heard 145 to 155 business days after the application was filed,
and have an order issued within 15 business days after the hearing. T2 and T6
(tenant rights and maintenance) applications, which tend to be more complex,
were typically heard within 25 business days of their filing date, and the order
issued within eight business days of the final hearing.</p>

<h4>Mediation</h4>
<p>The Landlord and Tenant Board employs 21 mediators throughout the province to
provide mediation services where both parties involved in an application are
interested in mediating a resolution of the issues in dispute. In the 2011-2012 fiscal
year, approximately 38 per cent of all applications where both parties showed up at
the hearing were successfully resolved through mediated agreements and/or
resulted in consent orders.</p>

<h2 id="oset">ONTARIO SPECIAL EDUCATION TRIBUNALS</h2>

<h3 id="oset-1">Associate Chair's Messages</h3>

<p><em><strong>C&eacute;line T. Allard, Associate Chair</strong>
<br>Ontario Special Education (French) Tribunal</em></p>

<p>On behalf of the French and English Ontario Special Education Tribunals, I am
pleased to provide the following report on the work of both tribunals.</p>
<p>One of the unique features of the 1980 <em>Education Amendment Act</em>, which
guaranteed universal access to public education for all students, "exceptionality
notwithstanding," was that it provided parents with the right to appeal the
placement of exceptional students without having to go to court. The right of
appeal to an independent adjudicative body, whose members have a high level of
expertise in special education legislation and the ability to determine what is in the
best interest of students with exceptionalities regarding programs, services and
accommodation in an educational setting, continues to be an integral part of
Ontario's unique approach to providing natural justice and due process to these
students, their families and the education system.</p>
<p>Adjudicating these complex cases requires extensive knowledge, sensitivity and
understanding of exceptional children and the education system in relation to the
legal framework, as well as knowledge of teaching and learning strategies. Expert
witnesses often appear before the Tribunal and give opinions on key facts relating
to a broad array of exceptionalities. The expertise of the Tribunal in these areas is
evident in the background of the appointees and has been recognized and
acknowledged by all levels of courts.</p>
<p>Geographical representation across Ontario is also important when members are
appointed. Hearing panels are always made up of three members, and hearings
are held in a location that is convenient for both parties.</p>
<p>Special education is a constantly evolving field. While legislation may remain the
same, there are many new research findings that inform the identification of
exceptionalities and the determination of what is in the best interest of an identified
exceptional student. OSET members must ensure that they are well-informed
about such matters, since their mandate is more complex than the simple
application of the statute. Therefore, they regularly participate in ongoing
professional development activities related to their role as adjudicators and work
independently as well as collectively to maintain their level of special education
expertise.</p>
<p>As neutral adjudicators, and experts in special education, OSET members must
always strive to reach a decision consistent with the best interests of the student
based on the facts and evidence presented. I would like to thank all members of
both tribunals for their continuing service in the interests of Ontario's exceptional
students.</p>

<h3 id="oset-2">Legislative Authority</h3>
<p>The legislative mandate of the Ontario Special Education Tribunals (OSET) is
found in section 57 of the <em>Education Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. E. 2. Their primary role is
to adjudicate appeals initiated by parents regarding identification and/or placement
decisions made by school boards with respect to students with special needs
(exceptional pupils), and to make decisions that are in the best interest of these
pupils.</p>
<p>The Ontario Special Education (English) Tribunal hears appeals for students
enrolled in the 60 English-language school boards, both public and Roman
Catholic. Le Tribunal de l'enfance en difficult&eacute; de l'Ontario (fran&ccedil;ais) hears appeals
for students enrolled in 12 French-language school boards, both public and Roman
Catholic.</p>
<p>The fact that OSET is an appeal tribunal sets it apart from many other
administrative tribunals, to which applicants may apply directly. OSET appellants
must first have satisfied the prerequisites set out in the <em>Education Act</em> and its
<em>Regulations</em>, before they are legally entitled to appeal.</p>
<p>Section 57(4) of the <em>Education Act</em>, allows OSET to dismiss an appeal, grant an
appeal or make any other orders it considers necessary with respect to the
identification and placement of the child. An OSET hearing typically involves lay
and expert evidence presented by both parties, and OSET panels do not
necessarily choose either the school board's or the parents' preferred option, but
rather make their own determination based on the student's best interests.</p>
<p>The Tribunals' decisions are final and binding on both parties. Final decisions with
reasons are always rendered within 90 days of the end of the hearing process.
This is to reduce any further delay for the student, who must be provided access to
the most appropriate and enabling educational placement as promptly as possible.
Interim decisions are issued only if the timing of the school year makes this
essential in the best interest of the student.</p>
<p>Another factor that differentiates OSET's decisions from some other tribunal
decisions is that the parties (the parents and boards) continue to have a
relationship after the dispute is resolved. Parents do not have an easy option to
move their child from the local school administered by the local board to another
school in another jurisdiction.</p>
<p>OSET offers mediation to its appellants by its trained members. Mediation is
frequently successful in resolving the dispute, without the parents having to go on
to a hearing on the merits of the case. Mediation also assists with facilitating future
co-operation between the parties. By offering mediation support to the parties in
advance of the appeal hearing on the merits, the Tribunal further supports the goal
of encouraging dialogue and dispute resolution between the parties.</p>

<h3 id="oset-3">Operational Highlights</h3>
<h4 id="oset-4">Adjudication</h4>
<p>The current fiscal year opened with four cases on the register of the English
Tribunal, and one additional appeal was initiated during the year. Of these, one
appeal was withdrawn when the parents realized it was not a special education
matter, one appeal was resolved through mediation, and two were closed after the
Tribunal issued written decisions on the merits of the cases. At fiscal year-end,
OSET had one open case.</p>
<p>There were no appeals filed, and no open cases, with the French Tribunal.</p>

<h4 id="oset-5">Supporting OSETs adjudicative activities and member readiness</h4>
<p>To ensure that OSET is accessible to parents and efficient and effective in its
practices, it must be compliant with the relevant legislation, provide resources that
support and clarify the appeal process, and ensure that the public is aware of the
process and the rights of exceptional students and their families. Administrative
justice, as delivered by OSET to Ontario's exceptional students and their families,
must be accessible, accountable, independent and transparent in its procedures.</p>
<p>During the 2011-2012 fiscal years, OSET undertook a review of its resource
documents that directly and indirectly support the adjudicative process. The
following documents were revised and updated and are available on the SJTO
website.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rules of Procedure</li>
<li><em>Practice Directions</em> on the following topics:
	<ul>
	<li>Consent Orders</li>
	<li>Mediation</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The website includes a detailed document, <em>Information for Parties</em>, which sets out
the process that parties need to follow when appealing to OSET. This document
has been revised during 2011/12, to provide more information and guarantee
greater accessibility to parties before OSET.</p>
<p>All OSET documents are available in both English and French. This bilingual
approach and the assurance that families whose children attend French language
schools run by French language school boards have the right to appeal to a
French language Tribunal is mandated in OSET's original Order-In-Council.</p>
<p>In accordance with the previous year's Business Plan, during 2011-12 OSET held
one all-members meeting by teleconference in November 2011. Individual
members also attended workshops organized by the Ministry of Education and the
Society of Ontario Adjudicators and Regulators. In accordance with the OSET's accountability practices, all members are provided with written reports following conferences, workshops and training programs.</p>

<h2 id="sbt">SOCIAL BENEFITS TRIBUNAL</h2>

<h3 id="sbt-1">Associate Chair's Messages</h3>

<p><em><strong>Gary Yee, Associate Chair &emsp; Alternate Executive Chair</strong>
<br>Social Benefits Tribunal Social &emsp; Justice Tribunals Ontario</em></p>

<p>The past fiscal year has been one of both consolidation and change for the Social
Benefits Tribunal (SBT). We built on the excellent progress we had made in a
number of areas, particularly the increased predictability of our scheduling, and we
continued the efficient integration of our operations within Social Justice Tribunals
Ontario (SJTO).</p>
<p>I am proud of the work that the members and staff do every day. As a Tribunal in
the social justice area, we share a common bond that emerges from our concern
for fairness and accessibility, and that is reinforced by our daily interactions with
the persons who are so profoundly affected by our conduct and our decisions.</p>
<p>The procedural changes we had implemented were reflected in a revised Practice
Direction 4 on Rescheduling of Hearings and Adjournments, effective December 1,
2011. The SBT's Consultative Committee reviewed a draft of the Practice
Direction, and we thank the stakeholders for their contributions. The SBT
appreciates the constructive and cooperative relationship it continues to have with
the representatives of the appellants and the respondents.</p>
<p>The SBT is striving to be more accountable by making its decisions publicly
available, while of course protecting the privacy of the appellants. We started the
process to have our decisions available on the website of the Canadian Legal
Information Institute - <a href="http://www.canlii.org/" target="_blank">www.canlii.org</a>. The public accessibility of a Tribunal's
decisions is essential to promoting both the accountability and the predictability of
the Tribunal.</p>
<p>In the coming year, the Social Benefits Tribunal faces significant challenges
because of a sharp increase in incoming appeals that began in the last half of the
fiscal year. In meeting this challenge, we will build on the solid foundation we
already have in place, which includes the strong working relationships with our
stakeholders, and we will draw on the benefits of being part of a large clustered
organization. We will never lose sight of our goal to excel in our core work of
providing fair and accessible dispute resolution.</p>

<h3 id="sbt-2">Legislative Authority</h3>
<p>The Social Benefits Tribunal (SBT) was established in 1998 under Part IV of the
<em>Ontario Works Act, 1997</em>. Appeals are heard under that Act and the <em>Ontario
Disability Support Program Act, 1997</em>. The SBT is an independent Tribunal that
considers appeals by applicants who have been refused social assistance and
recipients of social assistance who disagree with a decision that affects the amount
of or their eligibility for social assistance. Members are appointed by Order-inCouncil,
and supported by legal counsel and administrative staff. The Tribunal's
head office is in Toronto, with regional offices in London, Ottawa and Hamilton.</p>
<p>The SBT conducts hearings throughout Ontario. Because of the sensitive personal
information involved in these cases, the legislation requires that all hearings must
be held in private. Most hearings are conducted by a panel consisting of one
member. The parties to the appeal are the appellant (the person who is appealing
the decision of the Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP) or Ontario Works
(OW) office) and the respondent (the Director of the ODSP or the municipal
administrator of OW).</p>
<p>Most of the appeals before the SBT are about whether the appellant meets the
definition of a person with a disability under the <em>Ontario Disability Support Program
Act</em>. Other appeals are about many different issues - examples include whether
the appellant is meeting all the requirements to look for work under the <em>Ontario
Works Act</em>, or whether the appellant reported income or other information that is
required by law to be reported. The SBT also considers issues regarding human
rights as part of its mandate.</p>

<h3 id="sbt-3">Operational Highlights</h3>
<h4 id="sbt-4">Scheduling</h4>
<p>The SBT built on the successful changes to its scheduling practices from the 2010-
2011 fiscal year, which saw a 37 per cent decrease in the number of hearings that
were rescheduled. Much of this success could be attributed to working with the
stakeholders to establish practical and predictable time frames for the first hearing
date. In 2011-2012, there was another decrease, with 400 fewer rescheduled
hearings, a drop of almost 12 per cent from the previous year. There were also
fewer adjournment requests by the parties. The SBT changed its approach to
such requests by working with the stakeholders to clearly categorize some
requests as matters that could be dealt with much more efficiently as an
administrative rescheduling, rather than seeking submissions from both parties.</p>
<p>The changes also led the SBT to review and revise its Practice Direction 4 on
Rescheduling of Hearings and Adjournments. Many of the revisions reflected the changes that the SBT had already made, and the revised Practice Direction was made effective on December 1, 2011, following internal and external consultations.</p>
<p>The SBT revised its scheduling manual for stakeholders to assure consistency in
scheduling. This document contains step by step descriptions of the SBT's
scheduling practices, and is available on the SJTO website.</p>
<p>The SBT continued to schedule some hearings to be conducted by telephone
where appropriate or where requested by a party, to save time and travelling. The
SBT also held its first videoconference hearing. The appellant and the interpreter
attended at a site in Northern Ontario. The member and the respondent were in
Toronto, using the advanced technology at the hearing site used by the Human
Rights Tribunal of Ontario.</p>

<h4 id="sbt-5">Early Resolution Program</h4>
<p>The Early Resolution Program (ERP) continued successfully during this fiscal year.
SBT conducted approximately 300 Early Resolution sessions. The ERP process
usually involves a telephone call between the two parties and the SBT's Appeal
Resolution Officer (ARO), who acts as a facilitator to discuss possible ways to
resolve the appeal without the need for a full hearing. The SBT already has a
Practice Direction for the ERP, as well as a Practice Tips document, which are
available for the public on our website.</p>
<p>Ongoing training was provided to staff to keep their conflict resolution skills up-todate.
SJTO Tribunals will continue working together to share their collective
expertise and resources in this area.</p>
<p>This year, the SBT started scheduling Early Resolution sessions to discuss Interim
Assistance matters, before granting or denying the assistance. Both parties have
the opportunity to address the eligibility for Interim Assistance and to discuss the
matter under appeal to obtain a resolution, when possible.</p>

<h4 id="sbt-6">Adjudication Strategies - Human Rights Cases</h4>
<p>The Social Benefits Tribunal has continued to adopt a coordinated and strategic
approach to its many appeals that involve Human Rights Code issues. The SBT
developed an adjudication strategy for special diet appeals because so many
appellants submitted that the legislation concerning special diets contravened the
Ontario Human Rights Code. Rather than simply hearing each matter on a case by
case basis, it is more efficient to categorize the cases and bear in mind the work
that was also being done in this area by the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario. The
SBT is continuing to implement its adjudication strategy on special diet appeals
and to work proactively with parties to handle these files in as efficient a manner as
possible while maintaining fairness.</p>
<p>To this end, in July 2011, the SBT sent requests in 622 special diet files to
appellants and legal representatives asking them to send in a status report on their
appeals and received responses in 487 cases, which is greater than 75 per cent. In
272 files, or over 40 per cent of the total, SBT received responses that the
appellants wished to proceed with their files at the present time. The SBT has
started to schedule those appeals; some are suitable for early resolution sessions
and some will be scheduled for a hearing.</p>

<h4 id="sbt-7">Professional Development</h4>
<p>Member training occurred throughout the year in a series of monthly scheduled
teleconference sessions on a broad range of procedural and substantive topics,
including reviews of new relevant case law and changes to law and practices.</p>

<h4 id="sbt-8">Communication and Stakeholder Engagement</h4>
<p>The Social Benefits Tribunal continued its commitment to communicate effectively
with its stakeholders, which is essential to being an accountable, predictable and
proactive Tribunal. The SBT sent out regular communiqu&eacute;s to its e-mail list and
also posted these updates to its website.</p>
<p>During this fiscal year, the SBT held two meetings of the SBT Consultative
Committee that was formed in June 2010. The SBT consulted the Committee in
the review and revision of Practice Direction 4 - Rescheduling of Hearings and
Adjournments. The committee membership includes both senior and operational
level representatives from the Social Benefits Tribunal; Ministry of Community and
Social Services; municipal Ontario Works offices; and legal clinic representatives
of appellants.</p>

<h3 id="sbt-9">Statistics/Commentary</h3>
<p>For additional statistical information, please refer to the SJTO website.</p>
<p>In the fiscal year 2011-2012, the SBT received 13,435 appeals - a significant
increase of over 10 per cent (1,276 appeals) compared to the previous fiscal year.
The increase came at the end of the fiscal year, and this trend is expected to
continue into 2012-2013. The SBT completed 12,816 appeals, which was an
increase of over 400 from the previous year, but the SBT's pending inventory still
increased by over 800 cases. The overall average case processing time increased
slightly from 8.7 months to 9.2 months.</p>
