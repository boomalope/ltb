<h3 id="sjto-1">Executive Chair's Message</h3>

<p><em><strong>Michael Gottheil, Executive Chair</strong>
<br>Social Justice Tribunals Ontario</em></p>

<p>I am pleased to present the first annual report of Social Justice Tribunals Ontario
(SJTO), the second cluster of adjudicative boards and tribunals formed under the
<em>Adjudicative Tribunals Accountability, Governance and Appointments Act, 2009.</em></p>
<p>The regulation creating the SJTO took effect on January 25, 2011, and I was
appointed Executive Chair on March 7, 2011. Since then, we - the Associate Chairs
of the constituent tribunals and I - have been working to ensure a smooth transition
to the new structure.</p>
<p>That new structure deserves some comment. The concept of clustering adjudicative
tribunals, rather than amalgamating them as has been done in other jurisdictions, is
unique to Ontario. It brings together a specific group of adjudicative tribunals within a
single organization, but maintains each tribunal's unique statutory mandate and
membership.</p>
<p>There are many benefits to clustering. For example, moving responsibility for the
tribunals to the Ministry of the Attorney General positions the adjudicative process
firmly within the justice community. Opportunities to add services to regional offices
that previously housed only one tribunal should improve public access to SJTO
services. Clustering will also ensure the most efficient use of resources, and while
that is important in and of itself, efficiency is also a key component of access to
justice, since inefficient use of resources means that members of the public who
seek to access the tribunals may be delayed or denied. And last but not least,
smaller tribunals may find they have access to more resources, as the larger
clustered community creates opportunities for innovation and professional or career
development.</p>
<p>Over time, the new system should produce clearer, more consistent decisions, and
the long term benefit to the public should be a more accessible, more easily
understood and more predictable system for resolving disputes.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in this report, you will find a more detailed description of how we intend to
manage the transition in the coming 12 months, along with reports from the
constituent tribunals on their operations in 2010-2011. For more information, please
visit our web site: <a href="/en/">tribunalsontario.ca</a>.</p>
<p>July 2011</p>


<h3 id="sjto-2">The Role of the Cluster</h3>

<p>Section 15 of the <em>Adjudicative Tribunals Accountability, Governance and
Appointments Act, 2009 (the Act) states that the government may designate a
cluster when "the matters that the tribunals deal with are such that they can operate
more effectively and efficiently as part of a cluster than alone."</em></p>
<p>Social Justice Tribunals Ontario (SJTO) is the second such cluster to be designated
under the Act, following the 2009 creation of Environment and Land Tribunals
Ontario. The government announced its intention to form the social justice tribunals
cluster in August 2010 and passed the necessary regulation in January 2011,
bringing together the Child and Family Services Review Board, Custody Review
Board, Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario, Landlord and Tenant Board, Social
Benefits Tribunal, the Special Education (English) Tribunal and the Special
Education (French) Tribunal.</p>
<p>In addition to the broad goal of achieving efficiency and effectiveness in the way
constituent tribunals deal with their respective and collective subject matters, the Act
also requires that the cluster develop a mandate and mission statement as one of
several public accountability documents.</p>
<p>The Act also requires the cluster to develop a consultation policy, a service standard
policy, an ethics plan and a membership accountability framework. By April 1, 2012,
these documents must all be presented for approval to the Attorney General, with
the exception of the ethics plan, which must be approved by the province's Conflict
of Interest Commissioner.</p>
<p>The cluster is also subject to other policies set out by the Management Board of
Cabinet, such as requiring the cluster to develop an accessibility plan, provide
annual business plans and reports, and comply with other regulations, that ensure
public accountability within a framework of adjudicative independence.</p>
<p>For more on the role of the cluster, please see Executive Chair Michael Gottheil's
message at the start of this report.</p>


<h3 id="sjto-3">The Year in Review</h3>

<p>In just over three short months, SJTO has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Established a web site <a href="/en/">tribunalsontario.ca</a> to provide information to stakeholders and the broader public about the activities of the new cluster</li>
<li>Met with internal and external stakeholders to explain the clustering initiative as it applies to SJTO</li>
<li>Established an executive office and started coordinating and consolidating corporate functions such as information technology, finance and communications</li>
<li>Created a working group to examine ways of adding services to regional offices that previously housed only one tribunal</li>
<li>Started the process of developing the SJTO vision, mission and mandate statements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Coincident with the appointment of SJTO Executive Chair Michael Gottheil, the chairs of the constituent tribunals were appointed as Associate Chairs of their former boards or tribunals. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>C&eacute;line Allard, Associate Chair, Ontario Special Education (French) Tribunal</li>
<li>Suzanne Gilbert, Associate Chair, Child and Family Services Review Board and Custody Review Board</li>
<li>Lilian Ma, Associate Chair, Landlord and Tenant Board</li>
<li>Marilyn Thain, Associate Chair, Ontario Special Education (English) Tribunal</li>
<li>David A. Wright, Associate Chair, Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario</li>
<li>Gary Yee, Associate Chair, Social Benefits Tribunal</li>
</ul>
<p>Lilian Ma and Gary Yee were also appointed as SJTO Alternate Executive Chairs. A complete listing of tribunal members may be found starting on page 90 of this report.</p>

<h3 id="sjto-4">Performance Targets</h3>
<p>From the public's point of view, one of the most important documents required by the Act is the service standard policy. Most of the constituent tribunals have had formal or informal methods for measuring performance, but the Act makes such standards mandatory. Section 5 of the Act states that the service standard policy must contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>"A statement of the standards of service that the tribunal intends to provide;</li>
<li>"A process for making, reviewing and responding to complaints about the service provided by the tribunal; and</li>
<li>"Any other matter specified in the regulations or in a directive of the Management Board of Cabinet."</li>
</ul>
<p>In the coming months, SJTO will develop a common set of service standards, including a complaints policy, that will take into account the diversity of subject matter and the complexity of issues dealt with by the constituent tribunals.</p>

<div class="box">
<h3 id="sjto-5">French Language Services</h3>
<p>SJTO's constituent tribunals provide services to the public in both official languages
in accordance with the French Language Services Act (FLSA). Regional offices in
areas designated by the FLSA have bilingual staff available.</p>
<p>Additional information about French language services may be found in the
individual reports of the constituent tribunals contained in this report.</p>

<h2 id="cfsrb-crb">CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES REVIEW BOARD / CUSTODY REVIEW BOARD</h2>

<h3 id="cfsrb-crb-1">Associate Chair's Message</h3>

<p><em><strong>Suzanne Gilbert, Associate Chair</strong>
<br>Child and Family Services Review Board/Custody Review Board</em></p>

<p>I am pleased to present the 2010-2011 Annual Report of the Child and Family
Services Review Board (CFSRB) and Custody Review Board (CRB)<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>This year was marked by a very significant change that will shape the future of the
Board. The Child and Family Services Review Board and the Custody Review Board
became part of the newly designated Social Justice Tribunals Ontario cluster on
January 25, 2011. By the end of this fiscal year, we were just beginning to
appreciate the work that lies ahead with this very important structural change for
administrative justice in Ontario. A lot of work remains to accomplish this transition,
and the Board has embarked on this journey with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>In this fiscal year, the Board continued to see growth in the overall number of
applications. A more noticeable increase was observed in CRB applications.
However, the number of applications received and processed by the Board under
sections 68 and/or 68.1 of the <em>Child and Family Services Act</em> (CFSA) was less than
anticipated.</p>
<p>I am proud of what the Board accomplished this year. The Board has built a solid
foundation and become a stable, efficient and effective administrative tribunal. Most
notably, the Board's settlement facilitation program continues to evolve and has
proven to be a success in assisting parties to resolve complaints and concerns in a
more meaningful way.</p>
<p>I want to thank the Board members and staff who continue to contribute daily to the
excellence of the Board's work. The Board's success in achieving a high standard of
adjudicative excellence would not be possible without a committed team of Board
members and staff.</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> CFSRB and CRB are referred to collectively and individually as the Board.</p>


<h3 id="cfsrb-crb-2">The Year in Review</h3>

<h4>Challenge to the jurisdiction of the Board: Waterloo v. D.D.</h4>
<p>The work of the Board has been impacted by the decision of the Divisional Court in
<em>The Children's Aid Society of Waterloo v. D.D.</em>, 2010 ONSC 3328 (CanLII) (Waterloo
v. D.D.).</p>
<p>On July 20, 2010, the Divisional Court released its decision on a judicial review of a
Board decision regarding the Board's jurisdiction under section 68.1(8) of the CFSA,
which prohibits the Board from dealing with a complaint when the subject of the
complaint is an issue that has been decided by the court or is before the court.
In this particular case, the Board claimed it had jurisdiction to proceed with an
application when there are child protection proceedings, while the children's aid
society claimed it did not. The Court found in favour of the society.</p>
<p>The Board appealed this decision and the hearing before the Court of Appeal for
Ontario was heard on March 1, 2011. As of March 31, 2011, the Divisional Court's
ruling binds the Board. The Board has continued to accept new applications under
section 68 and 68.1 but placed on hold new and active applications impacted by the
Divisional Court decision<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<h4>Volume of Work</h4>
<p>The Board experienced an increase of 15% in the overall number of applications.
The increase is less than the one observed in the 2009/2010 fiscal year but is
consistent with the yearly increase in the number of applications received since
2006. The number of CRB applications received increased by 21%. Communication
materials provided in January 2010 by the Board to all youth justice facilities in
Ontario has continued to contribute to a better understanding of the Board's
mandate and may explain the increase observed during this fiscal year.</p>
<p>The Board also experienced increases in emergency secure treatment applications
and in school board expulsion appeals. Additionally, the number of applications
related to reviews of children's aid societies' decisions saw a slight increase of 3%.
An analysis of the intake of section 68 and 68.1 applications prior to and following
the release of the decision of the Divisional Court reveals that the Board received
30% fewer applications than it had forecasted in 2010-2011.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> The Board's appeal was granted by the Court of Appeal for Ontario on June 9,
2011, in <em>Children's Aid Society of Waterloo v. D.D.</em>, 2011 ONCA 441 (CanLII).</p>

<p>The following chart provides a summary of the Board's caseload for the last two fiscal years.</p>

<br>

<p>The overall number of applications that proceeded to a hearing decreased from 66 in
2009-2010 to 41 in 2010-2011, a 38% decrease. However, the average number of
hearing days scheduled for sections 61 and 144 doubled in this fiscal year. The
increase can be attributed to the complexity of the issues involved in these
applications.</p>

<h4>Settlement Facilitation</h4>
<p>Settlement facilitation (mediation) has been offered to the parties since July 2008 as 
part of the Board's hearing process for complaints made under sections 68 and 68.1 
of the CFSA. The settlement facilitation program continues to provide an opportunity 
for applicants and children's aid societies to arrive at a mutually agreed upon 
outcome. This model is consistent with alternative dispute resolution models used in 
Ontario's administrative tribunals and courts to settle matters in a non-adversarial 
manner. The settlement facilitation program has evolved into a major component of 
the Board's adjudicative process.</p>
<p>The Board has developed a performance appraisal for members involved in the
settlement facilitation team. This was a unique initiative undertaken by the Board as 
almost no other board has developed a similar tool. The goals of having a 
performance appraisal are to provide the Associate Chair with a sound process for 
assessing the performance of members when conducting facilitation, to allow the 
identification of training needs for members, to identify Board members who could 
mentor other members engaged in Settlement Facilitation, and to provide 
information pertinent to the operation of and potential improvement of the Settlement 
Facilitation Program.</p>
<p>An analysis of the settlement facilitation program for 2010-2011 found that parties 
have continued to participate in the program and the vast majority of applications 
were settled. For further information, please see the analysis of section 68 
applications.</p>
<p>This year's analysis of the terms of settlement agreements revealed that the Board's 
settlement facilitation program continues to address complaints such as a society's 
refusal to investigate allegations of abuse, apprehension of children, the care of 
children in a society's custody or supervision, and services provided to children in 
care. Terms also addressed ongoing services provided to children and families, 
complaints about caseworkers and access issues/arrangements between children 
and parents. The settlement facilitation program continues to provide an opportunity 
for applicants to be heard in a non-adversarial setting.</p>

<h3 id="cfsrb-crb-3">Ongoing Board Training</h3>
<p>The Board continued to provide focused and in-depth training for Board members 
and staff. Three days of general training were held in May 2010. Topics included 
child witnesses, self-represented applicants, learning disabilities and literacy. Other 
subjects discussed included the effects of child abuse and maltreatment on children, 
and parental alienation. The Board invited expert guest speakers to provide 
information and their insights on these important subjects. Staff was invited for part 
of this training session.</p>
<p>Additional training was organized to address specific areas of Board members' 
responsibilities. In October 2010 the Board's settlement facilitation team participated 
in a one day training session. In December 2010 training was provided on writing 
reasons for decision or recommendations. This session also included a presentation 
by an expert on plain language writing who conveyed the importance of 
communicating with the parties and the public in clear language.</p>

<h3 id="cfsrb-crb-4">On-Site Hearings and Settlement Facilitation Conferences</h3>
<p>In February 2010, the Board obtained approval from the Ministry of Children and 
Youth Services (MCYS) to acquire additional space to build a hearing room and 
settlement facilitation room at its current location. Construction for this project began 
in March 2010 and all renovations were completed in July 2010. Following 
completion of the project the Board began scheduling on-site proceedings for all 
applications received from the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). Renting hotel meeting 
rooms or other public facilities to conduct hearings and settlement facilitation 
conferences in the GTA is no longer necessary. This ensures the privacy of the 
proceedings and reduces costs. The Board is also able to host training sessions and 
various meetings on site.</p>

<h3 id="cfsrb-crb-5">Self-Represented Applicants</h3>
<p>Again this year, the vast majority of applicants were not represented by legal 
counsel. In order to respond adequately to the needs of those applicants, the Board 
produced two pamphlets entitled Useful Information for Self-Represented Applicants, 
which provides general information about the Board, and Hearing Information for 
Self-Represented Applicants, which provides information on how to prepare for the 
hearing. The material is also accessible through the Board's website at <a href="/cfsrb/">tribunalsontario.ca/cfsrb</a>.</p>

<h3 id="cfsrb-crb-6">Case Management System Upgrade</h3>
<p>The Board completed its upgrade to a web-based case management system in 
2010-2011.</p>
<p>This advanced system has refined the Board's business functions including the 
processing of applications, case inquiries scheduling of pre-hearings, settlement 
facilitation conferences and hearings and document management.</p>

<h4>Board Membership</h4>
<p>At the end of the fiscal year, Board membership included one full-time Associate 
Chair, two full-time Vice-Chairs and 24 part-time Board members for a total of 27 
members. All Board members are also appointed to the Custody Review Board. Six 
new part-time Board members were appointed to the Board in this fiscal year.</p>
<p>The Board continued to ensure that the hearing panels comprised Board members 
who have professional experience related to the type of application being heard. The 
composition of the panels often included a combination of members who are lawyers 
and professionals from the social work, mental health or education fields.</p>

<h3 id="cfsrb-crb-7">Who We Are</h3>
<p>Board members come from a variety of backgrounds in the legal, social services, 
mental health and education fields. The Board's membership is diverse, with 
representation from many different communities. Bilingual Board members are 
available to conduct hearings in both official languages.</p>
<p>The CFSA sets out the following requirements to become a member of the Board: a
degree, diploma or certificate granted by a university or other post-secondary 
institution authorized to grant such credentials in Ontario or equivalent qualifications, 
as determined by the Chair of the Board, and at least one year's experience working 
in or volunteering in children's services or social services; or at least five years' 
experience working in or volunteering in children's services or social services.</p>
<p>With the implementation of the settlement facilitation program, mediation skills and experience are also assets.</p>
<p>To become a member of the Board, potential candidates apply to the Public 
Appointments Secretariat. The selection process for both Boards includes a review 
of applications to determine if candidates meet the requirements, followed by 
structured interviews.</p>
<p>In consultation with the Associate Chair, the Executive Chair recommends 
candidates to the Minister of the Attorney General for consideration. Board members 
are appointed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council for terms of two, three and five 
years.</p>
<p>The adjudicative process was supported by 11 qualified and dedicated staff.</p>

<h4>What We Do</h4>
<h5>The Child and Family Services Review Board</h5>

<p>The Board's legislative responsibilities continue to be wide and varied as reflected 
by the different pieces of legislation summarized below:</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>
<p>The number of section 61 applications showed a modest increase in this fiscal year, 
while the number of hearings increased from two in 2009-2010 to five in 2010-2011. 
There was also a significant increase in the number of hearing days from three to 20 
in this fiscal year. The complexity of issues raised in the applications received under 
section 61 has resulted in the increased number of hearing days.</p>
<p>The pre-hearings allowed the Board to be better prepared for hearings, and also 
assisted the parties in resolving matters outside of the hearing process.</p>
<p>Nine of the 17 eligible section 61 applications received in this fiscal year pertained to 
situations where the society removed children from the foster home due to alleged
risk of harm or concerns regarding level of care. Three of the eligible applications 
pertained to situations where the society removed the child from the foster home for 
treatment and/or to address the needs of the child. In two of the eligible applications, 
the removal was to place the child in the care of family members.</p>

<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>
<p>There was a slight increase in the number of section 144 applications in 2010-2011. 
While the number of hearings decreased from nine in 2009-2010 to seven in this 
fiscal year, there was an increase in the number of hearing days from 17 to 29 in 
2010-2011. The increase can be attributed to the complex nature of the issues 
presented to the Board.</p>
<p>One application was withdrawn during the pre-hearing and four applications were 
withdrawn before the eligibility decision.</p>
<p>Consistent with the past three fiscal years, all the applications received challenged 
decisions made by children's aid societies. There were no applications requesting a

<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The number of applications increased from 203 in the last fiscal year to 210 in 2010/2011.</li>
<li>Fifteen applications proceeded to a hearing in this fiscal year and 18 hearing days were completed.</li>
<li>The Board's jurisdiction was challenged in seven (47%) of the 15 applications that proceeded to a hearing. After holding a hearing, the Board determined that it had jurisdiction to proceed with two of those seven applications.</li>
<li>Seventeen decisions were issued in 2010-2011. One decision was issued on jurisdiction only and the application was dismissed. Orders were made in favour of applicants either in whole or in part in 11 cases. In three cases the Board issued an order to dismiss the application. In addition, two decisions regarding compliance with the Board order were issued where the Board remained seized over the implementation of its order.</li>
<li>Of 22 applications that were withdrawn, five applications were withdrawn because the parties resolved the matter themselves, and one application was withdrawn because the applicant chose to address his complaint through the Children's Aid Society's Internal Complaint Review Panel. There is no requirement for applicants to provide the Board with reasons for their decision to withdraw. Applications were withdrawn at various stages of the process.</li>
<li>Sixteen applications were closed due to no contact between the applicant and the Board. The Board lost contact with applicants either following a request for more information or for dates of availability to schedule their files.</li>
<li>At the end of this fiscal year, 60 files had been put on hold, waiting for the Court of Appeal to release its decision on the Board's jurisdiction.</li>
<li>In summary, 90 applications were settled after either a pre-hearing or settlement facilitation conference; 17 reasons for decisions on jurisdiction and/or merits as well as 10 written reviews and 134 pre-hearing reports were issued in this fiscal year.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Settlement Facilitation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There were131 applications scheduled for settlement facilitation. A settlement facilitation discussion actually occurred in 106 applications.</li>
<li>A settlement agreement was reached in 87 applications. This includes four applications where the terms of settlement will be implemented in 2011-2012. The settlement agreement rate was 82%.</li>
<li>Parties reached a full agreement in 23 applications. This means that the file was closed at the pre-hearing stage and no further actions were required, as the applicants were satisfied with the explanations given during settlement discussions.</li>
<li>Sixty-six applications proceeded to the implementation stage. This occurs when parties need additional time, usually about 20 days, to implement the terms of the settlement agreement.</li>
<li>Of the 66 applications that proceeded to the implementation stage, compliance issues were raised in 12 applications (18%). Two of the 12 applications proceeded to a hearing as a determination was made that the terms of the settlement agreement were not complied with.</li>
<li>In 16 applications (15%), a settlement agreement was not reached and 15 of those applications proceeded to an oral hearing in this fiscal year.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>
<p>While there is a slight increase in the number of section 68 applications in this fiscal 
year, the Board had anticipated a more substantial increase based on trends 
observed over the last three years. The Board experienced a decrease in the 
number of sections 68 and 68.1 applications received in the months that followed the 
release of the Divisional Court decision in Waterloo v. DD.</p>
<p>The number of applications that proceeded to a hearing decreased from 37 in 2009-
2010 to 15 in 2010-2011. The Board assumes that more applications would have 
proceeded to a hearing if files impacted by the Divisional Court decision had not 
been placed on hold.</p>
<p>The number of ineligible applications remained unchanged from the previous fiscal 
year at approximately 10% of all applications received. The Board request to provide 
additional information in writing may have in the past discouraged some applicants 
from proceeding further with their application. Written communication may be 
challenging for some applicants. As a result of requesting less written information 
from applicants and by increasing contact by phone, the percentage of ineligible 
applications has remained stable at 10% in the last two fiscal years.</p>
<p>Children's aid societies and applicants were active participants in the settlement 
facilitation process. The settlement facilitation program has helped to finalize 
applications in a more timely manner. However, if an application proceeded to a 
hearing after a determination of non-compliance with the terms of the settlement agreement, the time for finalizing applications was lengthened. The percentage of 
applications finalized with a settlement agreement remained unchanged at 82% 
compared to the last fiscal year.</p>
<p>The number of applications that were direct complaints to the Board has remained 
consistent since 2006 at around 96%. Very few applicants requested a review of a 
decision made by a children's aid society's Internal Complaint Review Panel (ICRP). 
The Board does not have information to assess the reasons for the low number of 
applications requesting a review of a society's decision following an ICRP.</p>
<p>As in previous years, the reasons for dismissing applications at the written review 
stage included that the subject matter of the complaint was before or decided by the 
Court; that the applicant did not seek or receive a service from a children's aid 
society; and that the applicant was not a parent within the meaning of the Act, and 
therefore had no right to be heard. Written reviews were only completed when the 
facts were clear and there was no need for an oral hearing.</p>
<p>Once again this year, almost all applicants were self-represented and children's aid 
societies were represented by counsel. Consequently, staff was required to spend 
much time assisting applicants through Board processes. As mentioned earlier, 
specific information about the Board and its hearing process has been developed for 
self-represented applicants in the form of a pamphlet and has been made available 
on the Board's website. This information will enable self-represented applicants to 
have a better understanding of the Board's mandate and hearing process.</p>
<p>The number of cases closed because the applicant did not maintain contact, 16, is 
stable compared to 19 cases in 2009-2010. Again, the Board relied less on written 
correspondence and more on telephone contacts when further information was 
required to proceed with an application. This procedure is in keeping with the need 
for boards and tribunals to adequately address literacy issues.</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>
<p>The number of emergency secure treatment applications received by the Board 
increased from the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p>There are three emergency secure treatment facilities in Ontario. Consistent with 
last year, the vast majority of applications were from children admitted to Youthdale 
Treatment Centre.</p>
<p>Hearing dates must be set within five days of the Board receiving the application. 
Applications that are withdrawn represent approximately 60% of the applications 
received in this fiscal year. Withdrawals are often made at a final stage of the
process and are unpredictable. A considerable amount of work is performed up to 
the time an application is withdrawn.</p>
<p>The Board does not have information to explain the high number of withdrawals as 
applicants are not required to provide an explanation to the Board. However, the 
Board has implemented a more comprehensive withdrawal process, which requires 
that the applicant sign a form before withdrawing the application. On four of the 
withdrawal forms received, the applicants indicated that their decision to withdraw 
was because the facility decided to discharge them.</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>
<p>The Board continues to receive a very low number of applications in relation to the 
current number of children in care.</p>
<p>Two applications were determined to be ineligible because the applicant had not 
requested a review of the placement to the Residential Placement Advisory 
Committee (RPAC) prior to the application. This is a requirement before the Board 
may proceed with an application. Two applications were closed because the child 
was transferred from the residential placement, resulting in the Board's loss of 
jurisdiction to proceed with the application. In two applications the Board was asked 
to facilitate settlement discussion and a settlement was reached by the parties.</p>
<p>The Board will explore ways to raise awareness about its jurisdiction over the review 
of residential placements. Outreach may include providing information to residential 
placement facilities, and working in collaboration with the OCL and the Office of the 
Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth. This may ensure better access to the 
Board's review process for youth who want a change in their residential placement. 
It is anticipated that this project will be completed in the next fiscal year.</p>

<li>Of the 89 recommendations issued, the Board confirmed the Provincial Director's decision in 40 applications and made other recommendations in 49 applications.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>
<p>The Board has again seen another significant increase in the number of CRB 
applications this fiscal year, from 159 the previous year to 192 in 2010-2011. The number of applications has more than tripled since the 2008-2009 fiscal year. This 
could be attributed to the Board's continued efforts to inform youth about the CRB's 
mandate. As agreed between the Board and MCYS last fiscal year, facilities started 
to include in the youth's orientation package, a pamphlet containing information 
about the CRB application process. Also, every facility in Ontario has received 
posters informing the youth about the right to apply to the CRB.</p>
<p>Operational issues at facilities such as construction, re-organization and re-training 
of staff have continued to impact placements in the youth justice system. When a 
facility faced change that resulted in the need to close beds on a temporary basis, 
youth were often moved further away from their home community. This has led to an 
increase in the number of reviews related to the loss of family contact because of
distance. Such transfers have also created situations where youth have alleged that 
they felt racially and culturally isolated.</p>
<p>The Board held one hearing. The applicant was a youth whose mother was seriously 
ill and lived many hours away from the Northern facility in which he was placed. The 
Board heard evidence about the racial isolation that this applicant and three other 
transferred youths experienced as African Canadians in a facility with no other 
African Canadian youth. The application also raised the issues that there was no 
African Canadian staff and there was a lack of appropriate cultural programming. 
The Board recommended that the youth be returned to a placement in his home 
community.</p>
<p>In general, applications to the CRB tend to focus on family contact. There were 
fewer applications this year relating to safety concerns and programming. In terms of 
youth with mental health needs, the Board made several recommendations this year 
for youth to be transferred to the relatively new, specialized mental health unit for 
males at Syl Apps Youth Centre. The Board has also dealt with issues relating to 
youth with medical needs. </p>

<h3 id="cfsrb-crb-9">Decisions</h3>

<h4>Section 144 (refusals of applications to adopt specific children)</h4>

<h5>D.M. & C.M. v. Family, Youth & Child Services of Muskoka</h5>
<p>In <em>D.M. & C.M. v. Family, Youth & Child Services of Muskoka</em>, the society had refused the adoption application of foster parents of children aged 3 and 2 based on the findings of two home studies that did not approve the applicants for adoption, because the applicant was 
estranged from his adult daughters. The Board allowed the applicants appeal based on the evidence before 
it and not just on the assessment of whether the home study process had been fair. It found that it was in the best interests of the children that they be placed for adoption with the applicants.</p>

<h5>C.S. & M.S. v. F&CS of the Waterloo Region</h5>
<p>A second noteworthy decision on a section 144 application involved two aunts whose application to adopt their nephew was refused by the society. Instead, the society's plan called for the child to be placed with a prospective adoptive family, the foster parents who had cared for the special needs.</p>
<p>The Board denied the request of the prospective adoptive parents to be added as party because their 
position was supported by and not different than the society's. The society called the prospective 
adoptive parents as witnesses. The Board then weighed the competing plans for adoption based on the 
evidence about the two families, finding in favour of the society and confirming the decision to refuse the aunts' application.</p>
<p>The aunts' application for judicial review of the Board's decision was dismissed by the Divisional Court in June 2011.</p>

<h5>J.C. v. FCS of the Waterloo Region</h5>
<p>In <em>J.C. v. FCS of the Waterloo Region</em>, involved the timing of the application and the Board's jurisdiction when there are ongoing protection proceedings. The society argued that the application to the Board about the adoption refusal relating to applicants' grandchild was late. The Board found that the application was not outside the ten day application period set out in the Act
because the society's notice to the applicants about their right to a review under section 144 was inadequate. Therefore, time had not started to run against the applicants. The Board found that the notice must use the wording in the Act and accurately describe the time limitation.</p>
<p>The society also submitted that the Board lacked jurisdiction because the child was not yet available for adoption as she was not a Crown ward, and argued that there were ongoing proceedings that included the father's plan to place the child with the applicants. The Board held that the issue of the review of an adoption placement refusal was within the Board's jurisdiction and not that of the Court. The issues before the Board and the Court were different. The fact that the father put a plan forward to have the child live with the applicants did not deprive them of their right to a review of the society's decision to refuse their adoption application. The Board held further that the society 
could not argue that the Board did not have jurisdiction based on the fact that the child was not legally available for adoption when the society itself elected to begin adoption planning before the child was made a Crown ward.</p>

<h4>Section 61</h4>

<h5>L.A.M & C.G v. Family & Children's Service of Renfrew County</h5>
<p>The Board heard the merits of one application under section 61 of the Act in <em>L.A.M & C.G v. Family & Children's Service of Renfrew County</em>. This application involved the removal of a 12 year old boy from his foster parents' home for risk. The issue for the Board was whether the child should return to the care of his foster parents or whether the decision to remove the child should be confirmed. The alleged risk involved an incident with the child and the treatment of another foster 
child by one of the foster parents. The Board found that there was no risk to the child subject of the 
application. The other foster child who had posed challenges for the foster parents was no longer in their care. The child was 12 and wanted to return to the care of the applicants. The views and wishes of the child were taken into account by the Board and were a factor that led to the decision to rescind the decision to remove the child.</p>

<h4>Emergency Secure Treatement Applications</h4>

<h5>S.I. v. Youthdale Treatment Centres</h5>
<p>The Board hears numerous emergency secure treatment applications (ESTA) each year. This past year, the Board used the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> ("<em>Charter</em>") for the first time in one of its ESTA hearings. In <em>S.I. v. Youthdale Treatment Centres</em>, the Board found that it had the authority to apply the <em>Charter</em> since it had the ability to decide questions of law and the ability to grant the remedy sought, which in this case was to exclude evidence. The Board ruled that the admission summary or the admitting form prepared by the facility's psychiatrist would not be admitted into evidence unless the psychiatrist was called as a witness and was made available for cross-examination. The documents contained the doctor's opinions that formed the basis for the child losing her liberty. The Board held that to admit the documents without making the psychiatrist available 
to the applicant to test that opinion would be a violation of the child's right under section 7 of the <em>Charter</em>, which protects against the deprivation of liberty in a manner that is not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. The Board also found that it could reach the same conclusion applying the principles of procedural fairness.</p>

<h4>Expulsions</h4>

<h5>N.N. v. Rainbow District School Board (SS10-0009)</h5>
<p>The Board also deals with appeals against school board expulsions. In N.N. v. <em>Rainbow District School Board</em>, a student had been expelled for cyber bullying, as permitted by Section 310(1)8 of the <em>Education Act</em>, which allows for expulsion when a pupil has violated a school board 
policy that provides for a mandatory suspension for an activity. The Board considered whether the school board had such a policy as a "threshold issue." The Board determined that since the policy gave a principal discretion as to whether to suspend for cyber bullying, there was no mandatory threshold to be met, and therefore no legal authority to expel the pupil. The school board was ordered to reinstate the student.</p>

<h2 id="hrto">HUMAN RIGHTS TRIBUNAL OF ONTARIO</h2>

<h3 id="hrto-1">Associate Chair's Message</h3>

<p><em><strong>David A. Wright, Associate Chair</strong>
<br>Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario</em></p>

<p>I am pleased to present the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario (HRTO) section of the 
Social Justice Tribunals Ontario 2010-2011 Annual Report. This was a year of 
significant change, not only with the establishment of SJTO, but as the HRTO 
continued to adapt its processes to take into account the needs of our users, our 
experience in resolving applications gained since 2008, and the volume of 
applications filed. Our goal in all changes is to ensure that the process of resolving
human rights applications is fair to all parties, expeditious, and proportionate to the 
issues raised.</p>
<p>Substantial amendments to the Rules of Procedure for new applications took effect 
on July 1, 2010. Most significantly, the amendments instituted a new summary 
hearing process. Summary hearings, which are typically scheduled for a half day by 
teleconference, may be ordered on the Tribunal's own initiative or following a 
request by a respondent. The issue in a summary hearing is whether the application 
should be dismissed, in whole or in part, on the basis that it has no reasonable 
prospect of success. Summary hearings reduce preparation costs for both parties in 
appropriate cases, assist in narrowing and clarifying issues where applications are 
unclear, lead to more expeditious resolution of applications that have no reasonable 
prospect of success, and ensure more effective use of Tribunal resources.</p>
<p>The HRTO also made changes to its mediation processes this year. Mediations are 
now scheduled for a half day rather than a full day. This has not had a significant 
impact on settlement rates, and has increased the number of mediations we can 
conduct. The rule changes also formalized mediation-adjudication: with the signing
of an agreement by all parties, the hearing adjudicator may mediate and then 
continue with the hearing if no settlement is reached. Mediation-adjudication may be 
requested by the parties or suggested by the adjudicator, and participation is always 
voluntary. Many applications have been settled through this process.</p>
<p>We were pleased to welcome three new Vice-chairs and nine new part-time 
Members to the HRTO early in 2011, as well as the Executive Chair and Alternate 
Executive Chairs of SJTO. Our new adjudicators bring significant diversity in life and 
professional legal experience that enriches the expertise of the HRTO. Several 
come directly from legal practice, including both sides of the human rights bar, while 
others are experienced adjudicators in related fields.</p>
<p>As the number of decisions in new applications increases, we are developing a 
jurisprudence of substantive and procedural human rights law that clarifies and 
interprets the rights and obligations enshrined in the <em>Human Rights Code</em> for all 
Ontarians. I am proud of the quality of writing in HRTO decisions.</p>
<p>The staff and adjudicators of the HRTO are dedicated in dealing with a heavy 
volume of cases and consequent heavy workload. I commend them for their efforts 
as we continue to change to meet the needs and expectations of our users and the 
people of Ontario, now as part of SJTO, a larger administrative justice organization.</p>

<h3 id="hrto-2">Mandate</h3>
<p>The HRTO's mandate is to resolve applications brought under the <em>Ontario Human 
Rights Code</em>.</p>
<p>On June 30, 2008, the human rights system in Ontario changed. As of that date, all 
claims of discrimination under the <em>Human Rights Code</em> are dealt with through 
applications filed directly with the HRTO. The Ontario Human Rights Commission is 
no longer responsible for receiving discrimination complaints from individuals and 
then referring them to the Tribunal. A third organization, the Human Rights Legal 
Support Centre, provides legal assistance to individuals who may have experienced 
discrimination under the Code.</p>
<p>The HRTO's primary role is to provide an expeditious and accessible process to 
assist parties to resolve applications through mediation, and to decide those 
applications where the parties are unable to reach a resolution through settlement.</p>

<h3 id="hrto-2">The Year in Review</h3>
<h4>Intake</h4>
<p>The HRTO handled over 53,000 telephone and 890 in-person inquiries in fiscal 
2010-2011. This represents a modest decrease in the number of telephone contacts 
and a significant increase in in-person inquiries.</p>
<p>As in the previous year, the majority involved questions about the HRTO's 
processes and the status of cases. These questions were answered by HRTO staff. 
However, a significant number of contacts - almost 15,000 - were referred to the 
Human Rights Legal Support Centre or its website for legal assistance.</p>

<h4>Caseload</h4>
<p>Since June 30, 2008, all claims of discrimination under the Code are filed directly 
with the HRTO under section 34 or 35 of the Code. In addition to these "New 
Applications," the HRTO is responsible for resolving two other types of cases that 
originated in the old system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transitional Applications: These are applications filed with the HRTO between 
June 30, 2008, and June 30, 2009, based on complaints originally filed with the 
Ontario Human Rights Commission under the old system (section 53 of the 
Code); and</li>
<li>Commission Referred Complaints: These are complaints filed under the old 
system where the Commission referred the matter to the HRTO for hearing.</li>
</ul>

<h4>New Applications</h4>
<p><strong>Applications:</strong> In fiscal 2010-2011, the HRTO received 3,167 applications, or an 
average of 264 per month. This was a reduction of 384 applications compared to the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p>A geographical breakdown of applications based on the first letter of the applicant's postal code shows:</p>

<table class="this-table" role="presentation" width="200">

<br>

<p>The following chart shows the number and percentage of applications based on 
each of the five social areas covered by the Code. Note that while most applications 
only allege discrimination in respect of one social area, some are based on more 
than one, so the total exceeds 100% by a small amount.</p>


<table class="this-table" role="presentation" width="200">

<h3 id="hrto-4">Mediation</h3>
<p>As part of the HRTO's process, parties are asked whether they wish to engage in
mediation as a way to resolve their dispute. Where parties do not indicate a
willingness to participate in mediation, the HRTO may follow up to explore mediation
as an option, but participation in mediation remains voluntary.</p>
<p>Mediation is conducted by an HRTO Vice-chair or Member who has expertise in
human rights and alternative dispute resolution. The HRTO's role in mediation is to
facilitate the parties' efforts in reaching a settlement. The HRTO does not approve
settlements. Settlements are voluntary and require the agreement of all parties.
The Vice-chair or Member may provide information on likely outcomes if the case
does not settle, or what outcomes have been reached in other similar cases. If the
case does not settle, another Vice-chair or Member is assigned to adjudicate the
matter.</p>
<p>During fiscal 2010-2011, the HRTO fine-tuned its processes to capture more
detailed and accurate information on mediation outcomes. Therefore, detailed
mediation information is being reported for the last quarter, January 1, 2011, to
March 31, 2011.</p>
<p>The HRTO held 433 mediations during the final quarter of fiscal 2010-2011.
Applicants were represented in 50% of mediations: 27% by lawyers, 6% by
paralegals; 13% by the HRLSC, and the remainder by some other type of
representative. Respondents were represented in 83% of mediations:
77% by lawyers, approximately 1% by paralegals, and the remainder by some other
type of representative.</p>
<p>Of the mediations held from January 1, 2011, to March 31, 2011, just over 60%
resulted in a full settlement. This is somewhat lower than the settlement rate of
approximately 67% reported for fiscal 2009-2010, but is not a significant change.
The lower rate results, at least in part, from the stricter definition of settlement now
being used in compiling statistics: all issues must settle to constitute a settlement at
mediation. The settlement rate is particularly encouraging given the move this year
from full-day to half-day mediations.</p>

<h3 id="hrto-5">Hearings and Decisions</h3>
<p>Where mediation does not result in a settlement, or the parties do not opt for
mediation, the HRTO issues a Confirmation of Hearing notice. Hearings on the
merits are usually in-person and are held in 12 regional centres across Ontario.
Procedural and preliminary matters may be heard by conference call, in writing or in
person. Decisions are available on-line at: <a href="http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onhrt/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onhrt/index.html</a>.</p>

<p>The Tribunal's approach to hearings incorporates the following principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Adjudicator plays an active role in the hearing process; the procedure may vary from hearing to hearing.</li>
<li>The Rules of Procedure allow the Adjudicator to adopt non-traditional methods of adjudication to best focus on the issues in dispute and to ensure the process is understandable and fair whether or not the parties are represented by lawyers or paralegals.</li>
<li>The Adjudicator has the power to question witnesses, receive testimony not taken under oath and limit the evidence or submissions on any issue.</li>
<li>The Adjudicator is a neutral decision-maker and cannot take responsibility for identifying and leading evidence.</li>
<li>The Adjudicator will adopt the approach which facilitates the fair, just and expeditious resolution of the merits of the application, based on the facts and the law, in light of the nature of the issues in the case.</li>
<li>Hearings are open, transparent and conducted in accordance with procedural fairness.</li>
<li>With the consent of all parties and the signing of the Tribunal's standard mediation-adjudication agreement, the hearing adjudicator may engage in mediation and continue with the hearing if no settlement is reached.</li>
<li>Decisions are clear, well reasoned, and concise, and issued in a timely manner.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following chart summarizes the 1,617 decisions issued in 2010-2011 involving
new applications.</p>

<table class="this-table" role="presentation" width="200">

<p>* This includes cases dismissed under the HRTO's new summary hearing procedure
based on a finding that the application had "no reasonable prospect of success."
<br>**The HRTO no longer prepares a decision for each withdrawal, and most
withdrawals are now confirmed by letter.</p>

<h3 id="hrto-6">Workload and Timelines</h3>
<p>In last year's annual report, the HRTO reported an increase in its open cases -
1,719 at the start of fiscal 2009-2010 and 3,384 at the close. The HRTO took a
number of steps in fiscal 2010-2011 to deal with this issue, including a move to halfday
mediations, formalization of mediation-adjudication at the hearing stage and the
shifting of adjudicative resources from the Transitional Applications to the New
Applications.</p>
<p>The results have been dramatic. The growth of the open cases slowed considerably
in the first half of fiscal 2010-2011 - from 3,384 to 3,918 - and in the last half of
fiscal 2010-2011, the HRTO closed more cases than it opened - 1,707 applications
received and 1,742 cases closed.</p>
<p>The HRTO had 3,910 open cases at the end of April 2011. Of those, approximately
230 are in abeyance because they have been deferred pending the outcome of
another proceeding or placed in abeyance for another reason, leaving 3,680 active
cases.</p>

<h3 id="hrto-7">Performance Measure</h3>
<p>The HRTO has established the following performance measure:</p>
<ul>
<li>75% of applications that are accepted as complete will be resolved within one year.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of the 2,032 accepted applications that were resolved in fiscal 2010-2011, 1,258, -
or 62% - were resolved within one year. The average time from acceptance to
closing was 336 days, with a median of 324.</p>
<p>This is a significant decline from the 95% reported last year. This is not surprising as
some of the more demanding early cases work their way through the process, but
improvements to address legitimate concerns about timeliness are being
implemented. The Tribunal is optimistic that the steps taken this year will result in
more cases being resolved within the one-year time frame. This will remain a focus
for the Tribunal in the upcoming year, with close monitoring of time lines and
continuing review of processes to ensure that cases are resolved expeditiously and
effectively.</p>

<h3 id="hrto-8">Transitional Applications</h3>
<p>The new human rights legislation provided a mechanism for dealing with the roughly
4,000 open complaints pending with the Commission on June 30, 2008. For a period
of one year - until June 30, 2009 - the complainant could bring the complaint to the
HRTO by filing an application under section 53 of the <em>Code</em>.</p>
<p>By the end of last fiscal year, the number of Transitional Applications had been
reduced to 731. The following chart shows the closures for fiscal 2010-2011. At the
end of fiscal 2010-2011, the HRTO had 283 Transitional applications still open.</p>

<br>

<h3 id="hrto-9">Commission Referred Cases</h3>
<p>Under the old system, the Commission decided which complaints would be referred
to the HRTO for a hearing. Under the new legislation, this continued until December
2008, when the Commission referred its last group of complaints. This work is nearly
complete. By the end of fiscal 2010-2011, there were 428 Commission Referred
Complaints still open. However, because many of these complaints involve related
issues, the effective number of active cases by fiscal year end was down to 37. Of
these:</p>
<ul>
<li>16 were at the hearing stage</li>
<li>11 were awaiting final decision</li>
<li>10 were being monitored for possible settlement or other reasons</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="hrto-10">Outreach Activities</h3>
<h4>Practice Advisory Committee</h4>
<p>The HRTO Practice Advisory Committee (PAC) continued to meet during fiscal
2010-2011, led by its co-chairs, Mary Cornish and Patty Murray. The PAC comprises
11 members who appear regularly before the HRTO, four of whom regularly appear
for applicants and four of whom regularly appear for respondents, and one member
from each of the following organizations - the Ontario Human Rights Commission,
the Human Rights Legal Support Centre and the Ontario Bar Association. The
HRTO's Associate Chair and Counsel to the Chair are also members of the PAC. A
list of the PAC's current members is available on the HRTO website.</p>
<p>The PAC met five times during fiscal 2010-2011 and provided advice on various
aspects of the HRTO processes, including changes to the Rules of Procedure
introduced in July 2010.</p>

<h4>Speaking Engagements</h4>
<p>HRTO adjudicators and staff were actively involved in speaking to various
stakeholder groups. In fiscal 2010-2011, HRTO representatives attended
approximately 30 meetings and conferences, speaking across the province to
groups including judges, lawyers, paralegals, teachers, students, other
administrative tribunals and delegations from outside Ontario.</p>

<h3 id="hrto-11">Decisions</h3>
<p><em>In fiscal 2010-2011, the HRTO issued approximately 2,000 decisions determining a
wide variety of issues. The following are some of the significant decisions released
this year.</em></p>

<h4 style="display:none;">Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario</h4>
<!--no actual h4 but i need to use h5 style for the next headings -->

<h5>Noble v. York University, 2010 HRTO 878 (April 22, 2010)</h5>
<p>The complainant, a professor at York
University, sought to end the
university's longstanding policy of
not scheduling classes on Jewish
high holidays. He claimed his efforts
were an exercise of his rights under
the <em>Human Rights Code</em> and that the
university took a series of retaliatory
actions against him that amounted to
reprisal under the Code.</p>
<p>The Tribunal emphasized that
intention is necessary to establish
reprisal under the Code. Based on
the evidence presented, the Tribunal
found that the university had not
violated the Code. On the contrary, it
had taken a cautious approach to the
complainant's efforts to change and
defy the policy. As a result, the
complaint was dismissed.</p>

<h5>Krieger v. Toronto Police Services
Board, 2010 HRTO 1361 (June 16,
2010)</h5>
<p>This case involved a police
constable whose probationary
employment was terminated
because of work-related conduct.
The applicant did not dispute that his
conduct was inappropriate, but
claimed it was caused by a traumatic
stress disorder that had been
successfully treated. The applicant
argued that the respondent failed to
consider or accommodate his disability, violating his right to be free
from discrimination in employment
based on disability.</p>
<p>The Tribunal found that the respondent
had reason to believe that the
applicant's conduct was caused by
disability, but failed to engage in any
meaningful process to determine
whether the applicant could have been
accommodated. Because the applicant's
disability was amenable to treatment
and could have been accommodated,
the Tribunal held that the applicant
experienced discrimination in
employment and ordered the
respondent to reinstate the applicant,
pay him $35,000 for injury to his dignity,
feelings and self-respect, and develop a
policy or policies for accommodation of
police officers with disabilities.</p>

<h5>Pieters v. Peel Law Association, 2010
HRTO 2411 (December 3, 2010)</h5>
<p>This case involved an incident in a
courthouse library restricted to lawyers,
articling students and law students. The
applicants, two black lawyers, were
working in the library when they were
asked for identification to establish that
they were entitled to be there. The
applicants claimed they singled out
based on racial profiling.</p>
<p>The hearing took place over three days,
with 12 witnesses providing different
versions of the incident. The Vice-chair
found that the applicants had
established a prima facie case of discrimination and the respondents
had failed to provide a credible and
rational explanation. As a result, he
concluded that the applicants were
questioned, in part, because of their
race and colour.</p>
<p>The Tribunal found that the
discrimination was at the less
serious end of the spectrum and
ordered the respondents to pay each
applicant $2,000 for the injury to their
dignity, feelings and self-respect.</p>

<h5>Arunachalam v. Best Buy Canada,
2010 HRTO 1880 (September 16,
2010)</h5>
<p>The decision includes a detailed
discussion of the principles to be
followed in determining the
appropriate remedy under the
<em>Human Rights Code</em> for injury to
dignity, feelings and self-respect. It
emphasizes the Tribunal's
responsibility to the community and
the parties appearing before it to
ensure that the range of damages
based on given facts is predictable and principled.</p>

<h5>Dabic v. Windsor Police Services,
2010 HRTO 1994 (September 29,
2010)</h5>
<p>This was the first decision under the
HRTO's new summary hearing
process, which was introduced
through amendments to the Rules of
Procedure on July 1, 2010. The
question before the Tribunal was
whether the application should be
dismissed on the basis that it had no
reasonable prospect of success.</p>
<p>In setting out the principles to be
applied, the Tribunal noted that in some
cases, the issue at the summary hearing
may be whether, assuming all the
allegations in the application to be true,
it has a reasonable prospect of success.
In other cases, the focus of the
summary hearing may be on whether
there is a reasonable prospect that the
applicant can prove, on a balance of
probabilities, that his or her Code rights
were violated. Often, such cases will
deal with whether the applicant can
show a link between an event and the
grounds upon which he or she makes
the claim.</p>
<p>In this case, the Tribunal concluded that
there was no reasonable prospect the
applicant could show a link to the
grounds cited. As a result, the
application was dismissed.</p>

<h5>Whiteley v. Osprey Media Publishing,
2009 HRTO 2152 (October 26, 2010)</h5>
<p>The issue in this case was whether the
<em>Human Rights Code</em> governs the
opinions expressed in a newspaper
editorial. The applicant alleged that an
editorial in a local newspaper
disparaged those who moved into the
area from elsewhere, amounting to
discrimination on the basis of place of
origin under the Code.</p>
<p>Citing the right to freedom of expression
in the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms</em>, the Tribunal held that a
newspaper editorial is not a "service"
within the meaning of section 1 of the
Code or a "notice, sign, symbol, emblem
or other similar representation" and,
therefore, concluded that the application
was outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction.</p>

<h5>Yuill v. Canadian Union of Pubic
Employees, 2011 HRTO 126
(January 18, 2011)</h5>
<p>The issue in this interim decision
was whether the HRTO has the
authority to appoint a litigation
guardian to conduct an application
on behalf of a person under a legal
disability where there is someone
willing to take on this role. The
parties agreed that the applicant did
not have the legal capacity to bring
the application on his own. The
question was whether his sister
could file the application on his
behalf.</p>
<p>The Tribunal departed from an
earlier decision and held that the
Tribunal's ability to control its own
process granted in the <em>Statutory
Powers Procedure Act</em> and the
<em>Human Rights Code</em> includes the
ability to appoint a litigation guardian
to represent a person under a legal
disability where there is a person
willing to take on that role.</p>

<h5>Toussaint v. Ontario (Health and
Long Term Care), 2010 HRTO 2102
(October 18, 2010)</h5>
<p>The applicant had lived in Canada
since 1999, but had no legal status.
She claimed that the denial of OHIP
coverage based on her lack of status
was discrimination on the basis of
citizenship under the <em>Human Rights
Code</em>.</p>
<p>The focus of this interim decision
was the applicant's request for an
interim remedy. She asked for an
order that the respondent provide
her with OHIP coverage pending the determination of her application based
on her medical needs. The respondent
argued that the Tribunal has no
authority to make this kind of
substantive interim remedy and that,
even if it did, it should not do so in this
case.</p>
<p>Departing from an earlier decision, the
Tribunal held that although there is no
specific authority in the Code for making
substantive interim orders, section16.1
of the <em>Statutory Powers Procedure Act</em>
provides sufficient authority. The
Tribunal declined to make the requested
order in this case because of the
hurdles the applicant faced in
establishing discrimination under the
Code and the lack of any immediate
urgency.</p>

<h5>Mafinezam v. University of Toronto,
2010 HRTO 1495 (July 8, 2010)</h5>
<p>The applicant alleged that the
respondent discriminated against him on
the basis of creed and place of origin
when it banned him from a building. He
also claimed he was threatened or
intimidated by the University of Toronto
police.</p>
<p>The respondent argued the application
was out of time. In its submission there
was one incident - the issuance of a
Trespass Notice in July 2004 - and
because the application was not filed
until February 2010, it was too late. The
applicant took the position that the
incident was ongoing because of the
continuing effects or consequences of
the Notice and, therefore, his application
was timely.</p>
<p>The Tribunal held that the incident of
alleged discrimination was the issuance
of the Trespass Notice in July 2004, rejecting the argument that the
continuing effects of an act of
alleged discrimination constitute
further acts of discrimination. The
Tribunal concluded that the applicant
had failed to establish "good faith" within
the meaning of the legislation.
Therefore, the application was
dismissed.</p>

<h2 id="ltb">LANDLORD AND TENANT BOARD</h2>

<h3 id="ltb-1">Associate Chair's Message</h3>

<p><em><strong>Lilian Ma, Associate Chair &emsp; Alternate Executive Chair</strong>
<br>Landlord and Tenant Board &emsp; Social Justice Tribunals Ontario</em></p>

<p>I am pleased to report that over the past year, the Landlord and Tenant Board has
continued to function well in fulfilling its dual mandate: providing information to
landlords and tenants about their rights and obligations and providing dispute
resolution through adjudication and mediation. I am grateful to the Board Members
and staff who work together so effectively as a team in delivering these important
services to tenants and landlords.</p>
<p>My appreciation and thanks also go to Laura Bryce, Chief Operating Officer, and the
senior management team of the Board, including Vice Chairs, Regional Managers
and Managers of Customer Service, as well as the Legal Services Branch and
Program Development Unit, who all play important roles in the management, policy,
training and committee work they do for the Board.</p>
<p>I sincerely thank stakeholders from the landlord and tenant communities for their
valuable feedback and input by way of regular meetings, correspondence and
consultation. Our on-going dialogue ensures that both landlord and tenant groups
have a voice in the development of procedures, forms, Rules of Practice and
Interpretation Guidelines.</p>
<p>I also acknowledge the valuable support of my Executive Assistant, Suzanne Evans,
and my Administrative Assistant, Sue Woodland, for the excellent coordination of the
many tasks of the Associate Chair's office.</p>
<p>The highlight of the past year for the Board occurred on January 25, 2011, when the
LTB became part of Social Justice Tribunals Ontario. We are looking forward to
opportunities to work with our other tribunal partners in a cluster setting, sharing our
knowledge, expertise and resources, and working together to be even more effective
for our clients.</p>
<p>As a result of the cluster initiative, in March 2011, we transitioned from the Ministry
of Municipal Affairs and Housing (MMAH), the LTB's host ministry for many years, to
the Ministry of the Attorney General. I would like to express my sincere appreciation
to MMAH for its valuable corporate support to the Board throughout the years.</p>
<p>The key initiatives of the Board over the past year include a regional realignment of
its offices, stabilizing and enhancing the Board's case management system (Cmore),
and achieving Level 1 certification from the National Quality Institute. For information
about these initiatives, please refer to the "Year in Review" section of this report.</p>

<h3 id="ltb-2">Role of the Board</h3>
<p>Section 1 of the <em>Residential Tenancies Act, 2006</em> (the RTA) sets out the purposes of
the Act, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide protection for residential tenants from unlawful rent increases and unlawful evictions;</li>
<li>establish a framework for the regulation of residential rent;</li>
<li>balance the rights and responsibilities of residential landlords and tenants; and,</li>
<li>provide for the adjudication of disputes and for other processes to informally resolve disputes.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Dual Mandate</h4>
<p>The RTA, which establishes the Landlord and Tenant Board (LTB), confers a dual
mandate on the Board.</p>

<h5>Dispute Resolution</h5>
<p>First, the LTB has a mandate to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants.
The RTA confers the LTB with the power to exercise a quasi-judicial function under
subsection 168(2) of the RTA, which provides that the Board has jurisdiction to
determine all applications under the RTA, and section 174, which provides the Board
with the authority to hear and determine all questions of law and fact with respect to
all matters within its jurisdiction under the RTA.</p>
<p>The RTA also anticipates the role of mediators to augment the quasi-judicial function
of adjudication.</p>
<p>From April 1, 2010, to March 31, 2011, the Board received 77,393 applications filed
under the RTA.</p>
<p>When landlords and tenants are unable to resolve disputes on their own, they may
choose to come to the LTB to have it resolved. Parties to an application are entitled
to a hearing before a Board Member.</p>
<p>At the hearing, the parties present their evidence and arguments and the Member
decides the outcome by applying the law to the evidence that is relevant to the
issues in the dispute.</p>
<p>The decision is in the form of a written order that can be enforced through the court
system. Thus, an order of the Board for eviction is enforced through the Sheriff's
office; an order for the payment of money is enforced through the Small Claims
Court.</p>

<h5>Provision of Information</h5>
<p>Second, pursuant to section 177 of the RTA, the LTB is required to give information
to landlords and tenants about their rights and obligations. In fulfilling this mandate,
the Board's Call Centre handles customer inquiries, in both English and French,
through toll free lines.</p>
<p>In the Greater Toronto Area, the phone number is (416) 645-8080; outside Toronto
the number is 1-888-332-3234. Customer Service Officers are available during
regular business hours. An automated telephone service answers frequently-asked
questions 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This year, the Board responded to
approximately 500,000 telephone calls.</p>
<p>The Board has eight offices that offer full service to clients. At those offices,
landlords and tenants can file applications and obtain information, as well as attend
hearings and participate in mediation.</p>
<p>The Board also has 33 off-site hearing locations to which Board Members and
mediators travel for hearings on a regular basis. There are also a number of
locations in the northern parts of the province where the Board regularly holds
hearings electronically.</p>

<h4>Mission Statement</h4>
<p>The mission of the Landlord and Tenant Board is to inform landlords and tenants
about their rights and responsibilities under the <em>Residential Tenancies Act</em> and
provide balanced and timely dispute resolution in accordance with the law.</p>


<h3 id="ltb-3">The Year in Review</h3>
<p>In 2010-2011, the Landlord and Tenant Board continued to deliver its services to
Ontario landlords and tenants by providing information on their respective rights and
obligations and resolving disputes filed as applications to the Board. The Board
strives to improve service delivery to its clients. Over the past year, this has been
demonstrated through a regional realignment, NQI certification, eGovernment
initiatives and amendments to the Board's Rules and Guidelines. This section also
looks at application processing trends over the past year.</p>

<h4>Regional realignment</h4>
<p>Effective July 1, 2010, the Board implemented a regional realignment as part of
modernizing the LTB's regional office structure and focused on streamlining
business processes to improve service levels. The new office structure enables the
Board to make the best use of existing resources to achieve stability in the
organization and remain responsive to stakeholder needs. These changes include
merging the Toronto East, Toronto North and Toronto South regions into one
Greater Toronto Region, reporting to a single Toronto Regional Manager. The three
existing Toronto regional offices have been renamed as District Offices. The Board
also created a centralized unit with the expertise needed to improve consistency and
quality in the processing of applications for above-guideline rent increases (AGIs)
and automatic rent reductions (A4s).</p>

<h4>NQI Certification</h4>
<p>On April 27, 2010, Dr. Lilian Ma, Associate Chair, and Laura Bryce, Chief Operating
Officer, accepted the Level 1 certificate from the National Quality Institute (NQI) on
behalf of the Landlord and Tenant Board. NQI is Canada's authority on
organizational excellence. Founded in 1992 by Industry Canada, it is an
independent, not-for-profit organization committed to advancing organizational
excellence across Canada (<a href="http://www.nqi.ca" target="_blank">www.nqi.ca</a>).</p>

<h4>eGovernment</h4>
<p>The Board's bilingual website, <a href="/ltb/">tribunalsontario.ca/ltb</a>, received approximately 1.5
million hits each month over the past fiscal year. All Board forms, Rules of Practice,
Interpretation Guidelines, complaint procedures, Policy on Accessibility and Human
Rights, and Selected Decisions are available on the website.</p>
<p>The Board has been developing five public education videos to improve accessibility
to information about the Board's processes. These videos will be posted on the
Board's website in English and French. Captioned versions will also be played in the
waiting areas of the Board's offices.</p>
<p>In April 2009, the Board began phasing in its new case management system. At the
beginning of the fiscal year covered by this report, the Board transitioned to the new
system, and work began on improving its functionality and exploring opportunities for
developing additional eServices for application filing. This work will continue
throughout the next fiscal year.</p>

<h4>Rules and Guidelines</h4>
<p>Section 176 of the RTA provides that the LTB can make rules of procedure and nonbinding
Interpretation Guidelines. While a Member may waive certain Rules in
appropriate circumstances, some Rules have a non-waiver provision. Interpretation
Guidelines, on the other hand, while not binding on Members in their decisionmaking,
are generally to be followed unless there is valid reason not to do so.</p>
<p>On January 4, 2011, the Rules and Guidelines committee released revised versions
of a number of rules and guidelines. These newly revised rules and guidelines can
be identified by the release date on the Board's website. At the same time, two new
Interpretation Guidelines were released: #18, "Restricting Public Access to InPerson
and Electronic Hearings," and #19, "The Landlord's Right of Entry Into a
Rental Unit."</p>

<h3 id="ltb-4">Application Processing - Statistical Information</h3>
<p>The following section provides statistical details about applications filed with the
Board from April 1, 2010, to March 31, 2011, showing the distribution of applications
by application type and by region, the number of applications filed and resolved, as
well as the number of reviews and appeals.</p>

<h4>Landlord vs. Tenant Receipts</h4>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the Board received 77,393 applications this fiscal year, which
represents a decrease of 678 applications (0.9%) from the 2009-2010 workload. The
distribution of application receipts has remained relatively constant since 1998 when
the resolution of landlord-tenant disputes was transferred from the provincial court
system to the Board's predecessor, the Ontario Rental Housing Tribunal. This past
year was no exception. Landlords filed 91% of the applications, and tenants filed
9%.</p>

<h4>Regional Distribution of Applications</h4>
<p>The regional distribution of applications filed with the Board is as follows:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://tribunalsontario.ca/documents/images/sjto-img-1.png" alt="Regional Distribution of Applications Filed"></div>

<h4>Applications by Type</h4>
<p>Terminations of tenancy and eviction applications continue to represent the bulk of
the Board's workload. Of the total applications received by the Board, 71.8% were
for termination of tenancy because of arrears of rent. The following charts show the
distribution of the Board's workload, by type of application, for the 2010-11 fiscal
year.</p>

<h4>Applications filed under the TPA</h4>
<p>During the 2010-2011 fiscal year, in addition to its RTA workload, the Board
continued to resolve applications that had been filed under the <em>Tenant Protection
Act, 1997</em> (the TPA), the legislation in effect prior to the implementation of the RTA,
but which remained unresolved on January 31, 2007, when the RTA was
proclaimed. As of March 31, 2011, only three TPA applications are still outstanding.
One case is being reheard as a result of a previous appeal to the Divisional Court,
one case has been adjourned sine die and the remaining case is still being heard.</p>

<h3 id="ltb-5">Performance Targets</h3>
<p>The Board has begun preliminary work to develop performance targets for various
aspects of service delivery to its clients. As a starting point the Board continues to
track statistics on a number of its processes with consideration being given to the
measures that can be put in place. This work will inform the development of both
Board-specific and cluster wide service standards in the coming year.</p>

<h4>Application Resolution</h4>
<p>At the end of the last fiscal year, the Board had 8,166 pending applications. During
the 2010-2011 fiscal year, the Board received a total of 77,393 applications and
resolved 75,420 applications. As a result, on March 31, 2011, the number of
unresolved RTA applications was 10,140. This number represents approximately
seven weeks work at the Board, which is the workload appropriate to warrant
smooth and continuous operation for the Board. The following chart shows how
application receipts and resolutions have remained relatively constant during the
year.</p>
<p>For the 2010-2011 fiscal year, the Board received 2,082 requests for review. Of the
reviews resolved during this time period, approximately 65% were sent to a hearing.
The Board also received 160 Notices of Appeal of Board orders.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://tribunalsontario.ca/documents/images/sjto-img-2.png" alt="LTB Regional Activity"></div>

<h4>Average Processing Times</h4>
<p>The Board tracks the length of time from the date an application is filed to the initial
hearing date that is scheduled, and the length of time from the final hearing date to
the date the order is issued. While most cases are resolved during the initially
scheduled hearing, some require more than one hearing appearance. A number of
factors, some of which are beyond the Board's control (such as the availability of
parties or their representatives, or the re-scheduling of matters that parties have
consented to because they wish to continue their negotiations) can affect the length
of time between the initial hearing date and the final hearing date.</p>
<p>The processing times generally correspond to the complexity of the application
types. Over the past fiscal year, on average, hearings for L1 applications (evictions
for non-payment of rent) were scheduled within approximately five weeks of the date
they were filed, and the orders were issued within three days of the final hearings.
L5 applications filed by landlords (for above-guideline rent increases) generally
involve the lengthiest processes. As a result they were heard, on average, 26
weeks after the application was filed, and the orders were generally issued within
three weeks after the hearing. T2 applications (about tenant rights), which tend to be
more complex, were heard, on average, within six weeks of their filing date, and the
orders were generally issued within six days of the final hearing.</p>

<h4>Mediation</h4>
<p>The Landlord and Tenant Board employs 21 mediators throughout the province to
provide voluntary mediation services to parties involved in applications before the
Board. In the 2010-2011 fiscal year, approximately 40% (11,548) of all applications
where both parties showed up at the hearing were successfully resolved through
mediated agreements and/or resulted in consent orders.</p>

<h3 id="ltb-6">Decisions</h3>
<p><em>The following summaries are a sample of the decisions made on different types of
applications filed with the Landlord and Tenant Board in various regions during the
2010-2011 fiscal year. The Board posts a number of decisions on its website at <a href="/ltb/">tribunalsontario.ca/ltb</a>. These and other decisions are also available on the website of
the Canadian Legal Information Institute (CANLII) at <a href="http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onltb/index/html" target="_blank">www.canlii.org/en/on/onltb/index/html</a>.</em></p>

<h4 style="display:none;">Decisions</h4>
<!--no actual h4 but i need to use h5 style for the next headings -->

<p><h5>TSL-28199</h5> (April 13, 2010) - <em>s. 61,
illegal act - s. 66, impaired safety -
s. 83, relief from eviction denied</em></p>
<p>The landlord applied to evict the
tenant for committing an illegal act in
the residential complex and seriously
impairing the safety of others. The
complex provides transitional
housing for homeless people.</p>
<p>On several occasions the tenant was
in a rage and threatened to kill the
manager and blow up the complex.
The police were called and the
tenant was charged with uttering
death threats and prohibited from
being near the complex.</p>
<p>The Board found that the death
threats are illegal acts and that the
tenant's volatile and violent conduct
impaired the safety of others. These
acts have affected the character of
the premises.</p>
<p>The Board also found that the
tenant's death threats were not the
result of a mental disorder, and
therefore the landlord had no duty to
accommodate him. The tenant was
given six days to vacate.</p>

<p><h5>TET-06241-10</h5> (August 19, 2010) -
<em>s. 31, vital service - s. 12, address
for service - s. 191(2), deemed service</em></p>
<p>The tenants applied for an order
determining that the landlord withheld
the supply of a vital service. As a
preliminary matter, the Board
determined that the landlord had not
provided the tenants with an address for
service, and tried to evade service of the
application and notice of hearing after
the tenants telephoned the landlord to
ask where she could be served. The
Board determined that the landlord was
aware of the hearing and chose not to
attend. The hearing proceeded in her
absence.</p>
<p>The Board found that the gas to the
rooming house was shut off because the
landlord did not pay the bill. The tenants
were without gas for 12 days. The Board
determined that the landlord had
withheld the supply of a vital service and
ordered a 50% abatement of rent for the
12-day period of $198 per tenant, and
an additional $100 for the inconvenience
and mental suffering they endured.</p>

<p><h5>EAL-05724-10</h5> (April 28, 2010) - <em>s. 64,
interference with lawful right or interest</em></p>
<p>The landlord and tenants entered into a
tenancy agreement that required the
tenants to put the water bill for the rental
unit in their name and pay for their water use. The tenants failed to do that.
Because the water account
remained in the landlord's name, the
municipality sent the landlord
numerous invoices and letters
threatening to cut off the water
supply unless he paid the water bills.
The landlord eventually paid the
outstanding amount of $1342. The
landlord applied to the Board to evict
the tenants.</p>
<p>The Board determined that the
tenants failed to comply with the
term in the tenancy agreement
requiring them to pay for their water
use. This conduct substantially
interfered with the landlord's lawful
right or interest. The Board ordered
the tenants' eviction.</p>

<p><h5>SWT-08650-10-AM</h5> - <em>s. 135, money
retained illegally - s. 19, Frustrated
Contracts Act applies - s. 3 of FCA,
sums paid before discharge are
recoverable</em></p>
<p>The tenant applied for an order
determining that the landlord
collected or retained money illegally.</p>
<p>On September 13, 2009, the rental
unit was destroyed by fire. In
accordance with the <em>Frustrated
Contracts Act</em> (FCA), the Board
found that the parties were
discharged from performance of the
tenancy agreement after that date.
Applying section 3 of the FCA, the
Board determined that the landlord
was permitted to retain a pro-rated
portion of the rent for the period
September 1 to 13; however, the
landlord was not entitled to retain the
balance of the September rent or the
rent deposit.</p>
<p>The Board determined that the landlord
had retained money illegally and
ordered it to be paid to the tenant.</p>

<p><h5>CEL-03708-10</h5> (May 28, 2010) - <em>s. 82,
adjournment - s. 183, Board to adopt
most expeditious method of proceeding
- Guideline 1, adjournment
considerations</em></p>
<p>At the hearing of the landlord's L1
application, the tenant raised issues
under section 82 of the RTA. The tenant
then requested an adjournment to
prepare for the hearing of the section 82
issues.</p>
<p>The Board denied the adjournment
request because the tenant should have
been prepared to present his evidence.
The Board found that to merely raise
issues and then seek an adjournment to
gather evidence in support of the issues
is not the purpose of section 82. The
Board noted that the Notice of Hearing
states that parties should be ready to
present their evidence and that if "you
want to raise any issues that are not in
the landlord's application, it is important
to bring evidence to this hearing to
support your claims."</p>
<p>The Board also considered Guideline 1
and section 183 of the RTA which
provide that the Board shall adopt the
most expeditious method of determining
the questions arising in a proceeding
that affords all persons affected an
adequate opportunity to know the issues
and be heard on the matter. The tenant
had been given the opportunity to know
the issues for both the landlord's
application and under section 82, and
should have been prepared to present
evidence in support of the issues. After the adjournment was denied, the
tenant elected to proceed with the
issues raised under section 82.</p>

<p><h5>SWT-09793-10</h5> (September 7, 2010)
- <em>s. 52, notice of conversion to nonresidential
use - s. 52,
compensation - s. 3, waiver or
agreement contrary to Act</em></p>
<p>The tenants applied for an order
determining that the landlords
collected or retained money illegally.</p>
The landlords had given the tenants
a notice of termination for conversion
of the rental unit to non-residential
use. The notice was void because
the termination date in the notice
was not the last day of the rental
period as required by section 50(2)
of the RTA. The tenants vacated
based on the notice.</p>
<p>The landlords contended that they
had an agreement with the tenants
that would allow them to occupy the
rental unit beyond the termination
date in exchange for the tenants'
waiving their right to compensation in
an amount equal to three months
rent, in accordance with section 52
of the RTA. The Board was not
satisfied that there was an
agreement because the terms were
never settled and there was no
specific offer and acceptance. Even
if there was an agreement, it was
contrary to section 3 of the RTA and
the Divisional Court ruling in
<em>1086891 Ontario Ltd. v. Barber</em>,
preventing a landlord and tenant
from bargaining away their statutory
rights whatever the circumstances.
In the result, the landlords were
ordered to pay the tenants
compensation.</p>

<p><h5>SWL-15272-10</h5> (November 10, 2010) -
<em>s. 78, landlord not entitled to apply for
ex parte eviction order after mediated
settlement satisfied</em></p>
<p>The settlement mediated by the Board
provided that the tenant would pay the
outstanding arrears and the regular
monthly rent in instalments continuing
up to February 2011. The tenant
satisfied the mediated settlement by
paying the full amount outstanding by
September 2010. When the tenant failed
to pay the rent for November 2010 the
landlord applied ex parte for an order
under section 78 of the RTA to evict her.</p>
<p>The Board determined that the tenant's
early payment of the full amount
satisfied the conditions imposed in the
mediated settlement and ended the
landlord's right to apply under section
78. The Board noted that this approach
is consistent with section 74(2) of the
RTA which requires that an application
for eviction based on arrears be
discontinued if, before an eviction order
is issued, the tenant pays the full
amount of rent that would have been
due under the tenancy agreement. The
Board stated that the landlord will have
to give a new notice of termination and
file a new application for any new
arrears that arose after the mediated
settlement was satisfied. The landlord's
application was dismissed.</p>

<p><h5>TNT-03488-10</h5> (September 30, 2010) -
<em>s. 107, collected money illegally - s.
135, refund</em></p>
<p>The tenant applied for an order
determining that the landlord
retained money illegally.</p>
<p>The tenant had applied for a rental
unit in the residential complex. The
landlord gave him an application
form that required the tenant to
provide five items of information and
a rent deposit. The tenant provided
four items but was not able to
provide an employment letter from
his employer. Instead, he obtained a
letter from the employer's trustee in
bankruptcy, but it was not acceptable
to the landlord. The tenant then
advised the landlord that he would
not continue with the application
process, and requested a return of
his rent deposit. The landlord offered
to return the deposit if the tenant
paid the landlord a $250 fee for
doing the paper work associated with
the application process.</p>
<p>The Board considered the Divisional
Court decisions in <em>Opara v. Cook,
Drewlo Holdings v. Custidio and
Benedetto v. Dineen</em>. In the Opara
and Drewlo cases, the tenant had
entered into a tenancy agreement
and therefore was not entitled to a
refund of the rent deposit. In
<em>Benedetto</em>, it was determined that
the tenants had not entered into a
tenancy agreement and the landlord
was ordered to refund the deposit.
The Board determined that, as in
<em>Benedetto</em>, the tenant had not
entered into a tenancy agreement
because the prerequisites in the
application had not been met, and
ordered the landlord to refund the
deposit.</p>

<p><h5>TEL-27008</h5> (April 7, 2010) - <em>s. 126,
above guideline increase - s. 2,
municipal taxes and charges - s. 2,
utilities - s. 202, real substance</em></p>
<p>In 2009 the City of Toronto removed the
cost of garbage collection from the
landlord's tax bill and placed it on the
landlord's "Utility Bill." The landlord
applied for an above guideline increase
in rent to recover the increased amounts
it is now paying for garbage collection
because of the change to a user-pay
system. The tenants argued that the
garbage collection fee is not a municipal
tax and charge as defined in section 2 of
the RTA and therefore should be
disallowed as an extraordinary increase.</p>
<p>The Board determined that, despite the
term "utility bill" used to describe the
new charges, the charges fall within the
definition of "municipal taxes and
charges" in section 2 because they are
"charges levied on a landlord by a
municipality." They are not utilities which
are defined as meaning "heat, electricity
and water."</p>
<p>The Board determined that the garbage
collection fee is properly recognized as
a municipal charge and the landlord will
receive the rent increase it applied for
based on this expenditure.</p>

<p><h5>SOT-08159-10</h5> (December 21, 2010) -
<em>s. 31, interference with enjoyment -
tenants' association - administrative fine</em></p>
<p>The tenant filed an application for an
order determining that the landlord
interfered with his enjoyment of the
rental unit by interfering with his
attempts to form a tenants' association.
The tenant posted a recruitment note on
the bulletin board in the lobby for the purpose of forming a tenants'
association. The following events
then occurred: the tenant received a
notice of entry; the tenants'
association sent a letter to the
landlord requesting repairs; the
tenants' association filed a complaint
with the city; the landlord gave the
tenant a notice of termination
because the tenant had a washing
machine, dryer and freezer in his
unit; the landlord removed from the
lobby the bulletin board on which the
tenants' association notice was
posted.</p>
<p>The Board determined that the notice of
termination was given as a reaction to
the formation of the tenants' association,
and that it substantially interfered with
the tenant's enjoyment of the rental unit.</p>
<p>By analogy to section 83(3) of the RTA,
which directs the Board to refuse an
application for eviction if the reason for
the application is that the tenant is
attempting to form a tenants'
association, the Board held that the RTA
is meant to protect tenants who
participate in such associations. The
Board ordered an abatement equal to
one month's rent and an administrative
fine of $500.</p>

<h2 id="oset">ONTARIO SPECIAL EDUCATION (ENGLISH) TRIBUNAL<br>
ONTARIO SPECIAL EDUCATION (FRENCH) TRIBUNAL</h2>

<h3 id="oset-1">Associate Chairs' Messages</h3>

<p><em><strong>Marilyn Thain, Associate Chair</strong>
<br>Ontario Special Education (English) Tribunal</em></p>

<p>As Associate Chair, I am proud of the Special Education English Tribunal's
accomplishments and confident that as a member of the Social Justice Tribunals
Ontario, we will continue to build on its current foundation and work hard to continue
to provide a high standard of adjudicative excellence.</p>
<p>The English Tribunal adjudicates disputes between a parent and a school board
concerning the identification and/or special education placement of an exceptional
student. The establishment of an expert administrative tribunal to adjudicate such
disputes is given curial deference by the courts and is unique to Ontario.</p>
<p>In 2010-2011, the English Tribunal welcomed one new part-time member, reviewed
and revised the Tribunal's policies and procedural documents, responded in a timely
way to inquiries from parents, school boards, and stakeholder organizations, and
continued to keep up-to-date with legislation, policy change and judicial decisions
that affect special education in Ontario. We remain informed of issues related to
special education to assist in fulfilling our mandate.</p>
<p>Two members successfully completed training in mediation. As a result, the English
Tribunal now has eight members who are qualified to offer alternative dispute
resolution services to parents and school boards. All parties are offered an
opportunity to participate in mediation prior to proceeding to a hearing. The
Tribunal's experience with mediation has been successful in resolving and
simplifying some of the disputes.</p>
<p>The Tribunal has 11 part-time members; in spite of this small membership, two
important documents were developed to enhance agency accountability: a member
accountability framework which includes role descriptions for all members and
positions, and a merit-based appointment process, which includes a telephone
interview, a face-to-face interview and a written assessment component. The
appointment process was implemented during 2010 and resulted in a
recommendation to appoint one new member from the thirteen applications made to
the Public Appointments Secretariat.</p>
<p>During the past few years, many of the appeals to the English Tribunal relate to the
special education placement of students who have been identified with autism. Data
about the number of appeals, the number of successful mediations and the number
and outcome of hearings follows in this report.</p>
<p>The part time members of the Special Education (English) Tribunal have expertise in
special education and are committed to providing timely, fair and effective decisions
that are made in the best interest of exceptional students in Ontario.</p>
<p>The Tribunal has been fortunate to have Louise Sibbald as Secretary of the Tribunal.
She has provided excellent support and service and has been especially helpful
during the transition to the Social Justice Tribunals Ontario.</p>
<p>The Tribunal looks forward to the challenges and opportunities that it will face as a
member of the new cluster of administrative tribunals. We look forward as well, to
continue to co-operate and collaborate with the other constituent tribunals in order to
work toward ongoing excellence and access to justice.</p>

<p><em><strong>C&eacute;line T. Allard, Associate Chair</strong>
<br>Ontario Special Education (French) Tribunal</em></p>

<p>I am very happy to announce that our Tribunal is now a part of Social Justice
Tribunals Ontario, headed by Executive Chair Michael Gottheil.</p>
<p>This cluster brings together tribunals and boards that have a set of common goals
and objectives. It will provide each of its members with the opportunity to take
advantage of the extensive collective experience, and to thus be able to better serve
the community in the context of their respective mandates.</p>
<p>Our Tribunal is very enthusiastic about being involved in this new initiative!</p>


<h3 id="oset-2">Role of the Tribunals</h3>
<p>The Ontario Special Education Tribunals' (OSET) legislative mandate is found in
section 57 of the <em>Education Act, R.S.O. 1990</em>, c. E. 2. Their primary role is to
adjudicate appeals initiated by parents, regarding the identification and/or placement
decisions made by school boards with respect to students with special needs
(exceptional pupils) and to make decisions that are in the best interest of these
pupils.</p>
<p>The Ontario Special Education (English) Tribunal hears appeals for students
enrolled in the 60 English-language school boards, both public and Roman Catholic.
Le Tribunal de l'enfance en difficult&eacute; de l'Ontario (fran&ccedil;ais) hears appeals for
students enrolled in 12 French-language school boards, both public and Roman
Catholic.</p>
<p>Providing parents with the right of appeal without having to go to court was one of
the unique features of the 1980 <em>Education Amendment Act</em>, which guaranteed
universal access to public education for all students, "exceptionality
notwithstanding." The right of appeal to an independent adjudicative body, whose
members have a high level of expertise in both special education legislation and in
their ability to determine what is in the best interest of students with exceptionalities
regarding programs, services and accommodation in an educational setting,
continues to be an integral part of Ontario's unique approach to providing natural
justice and due process to these students, their families and the education system.</p>
<p>Adjudicating these complex cases requires extensive knowledge, sensitivity and
understanding of exceptional children and the education system in relation to the
legal framework, as well as knowledge of teaching and learning strategies. Expert
witnesses often appear before the Tribunal and give opinions on key facts relating to
a broad array of exceptionalities. The expertise of the Tribunal in these areas is
evident in the background of the appointees and has been recognized and
acknowledged by all levels of courts.</p>
<p>Geographical representation across Ontario is important when members are chosen.
Hearing panels are always made up of three members, and hearings are held in a
location that is convenient for both parties.</p>
<p>OSET differs from many other administrative tribunals in that it is an appeal tribunal,
rather than a direct application tribunal. That means that appellants must first satisfy
the prerequisites set out in the <em>Education Act</em> and its <em>Regulations</em>, before they are
legally entitled to appeal. Because of the complex nature and length of the legislative
scheme set out in the <em>Education Act</em> and the relevant <em>Regulation</em>, OSET renders its
decisions promptly and only issues interim decisions if the timing of the school year
makes this essential in the best interest of the student.</p>
<p>The OSET does not necessarily choose the school board's or the parents' preferred
option, but rather makes its own determination based on the student's best interests.</p>
<p>The Tribunals were created to provide a final and binding decision on both parties.
OSET's final decisions with reasons are always rendered within 90 days of the end
of the hearing process. This is to reduce any further delay for the student, who must
be provided access to the most appropriate and enabling educational placement as
promptly as possible.</p>
<p>The appeal before the OSET is a hearing de novo, and typically involves lay and
expert evidence led by both parties. The central focus of the OSET is the best
interests of the student. The OSET is empowered to dismiss the appeal, grant the
appeal or make any other orders it considers necessary with respect to the
identification and placement of the child: <em>Education Act</em>, s. 57(4). As neutral
adjudicators, and experts in special education, OSET must reach a decision
consistent with the best interest of the student based on the facts and evidence
presented.</p>
<p>Another factor that differentiates OSET's decisions from some other tribunal
decisions is that the parties (the parents and boards) continue to have a relationship
after the dispute is resolved. Parents do not have an easy option to move their child
from the local school administered by the local board to another school in another
jurisdiction.</p>
<p>OSET offers mediation to its appellants by its trained members. Mediation is
frequently successful in resolving the dispute, without the parents having to go on to
a hearing on the merits of the case. Mediation also assists with facilitating future cooperation
between the parties. By offering mediation support to the parties in
advance of the appeal hearing on the merits, the Tribunal further supports the goal
of encouraging dialogue and dispute resolution between the parties.</p>
<p>Over the years, OSET has noted and reported on certain key challenges faced by
parents. These included the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>parents are sometimes not informed about their due process rights by the boards;</li>
<li>parents are sometimes denied access to the required pre-appeal steps, e.g., Identification, Placement and Review Committee (IPRC) meetings or Special Education Advisory Boards (SEABs); and</li>
<li>parents are frequently self-represented. Boards are invariably represented by legal counsel, which often results in an uneven power balance between the parties.</li>
</ul>
<p>OSET has responded to these challenges by ensuring that parties are well-informed
about the appeal process, that hearings allow for as much flexibility as is legally permissible, and that there is no undue delay in hearing an appeal and rendering a
decision in the best interest of the student.</p>
<p>Special education is a constantly evolving field. What that means is that while the
legislation may remain the same, there are many new research findings that inform
the identification of exceptionalities and the determination of what is in the best
interest of an identified exceptional student. OSET members must ensure that they
are well-informed about such matters, since their mandate is more complex than the
simple application of the statute. Therefore, they regularly participate in ongoing
professional development activities related to their role as adjudicators and work
independently as well as collectively to maintain their level of special education
expertise.</p>

<h3 id="oset-3">The Year in Review</h3>
<h4>Adjudication</h4>
<p>As the operational statistics included below show, during the past three years OSET
dealt with a total of 21 appeals. These were all appeals before the English Tribunal.
There were no appeals to the French Tribunal.</p>

<h3 id="oset-4">Operational statistics for the past three fiscal years</h3>

<p>* Open cases as of March 31, 2011. Open cases include cases awaiting a hearing
and cases where a decision has been issued, but the Tribunal remained seized of
the case.</p>
<p>The current fiscal year opened with five cases on the register of the English Tribunal.
This included two appeals where mediation had been successful, but the parties had
not signed a settlement agreement by March 31, 2010. Once the parties signed the
agreements, the cases were closed. In the remaining three cases, the parties
participated in mediation, but the dispute was not resolved.</p>
<p>In one appeal initiated in 2010-2011, the parent withdrew the appeal, once she
realized following the pre-hearing teleconference that her concern was not special
education specific. There were two hearings on the merits of each case,
with OSET remaining seized of both cases until June 30, 2011. Two more hearings
were pending at fiscal year end. As shown in the above chart, at fiscal year-end
OSET had four open cases.</p>

<h4>Supporting OSET's adjudicative activities and member readiness</h4>
<p>To ensure that OSET is accessible to parents and efficient and effective in its
practices, it must be compliant with the relevant legislation, provide resources that
support and clarify the appeal process, and ensure that the public is aware of the
process and the rights of exceptional students and their families. Administrative
justice, as delivered by OSET to Ontario's exceptional students and their families,
must be accessible, accountable, independent and transparent in its procedures.</p>
<p>During the 2010-2011 fiscal year, OSET undertook a review of its resource
documents that directly and indirectly support the adjudicative process. The
following documents were revised and updated and are available on the OSET
website at <a href="/oset/">tribunalsontario.ca/oset</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Rules of Procedure</li>
<li>Practice Directions on the following topics:
	<ul>
	<li>Consent Orders;</li>
	<li>Issuing a Summons;</li>
	<li>Mediation;</li>
	<li>Representation;</li>
	<li>Seized Cases;</li>
	<li>Student as Witness.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The website includes a detailed document, <em>Information for Parties</em>, which sets out
the process that parties need to follow when appealing to OSET. This
document has been revised during 2010/11, to provide more information and
guarantee greater accessibility to parties before OSET.</p>
<p>All OSET documents are available in both English and French. This bilingual
approach and the assurance that families whose children attend French language
schools run by French language school boards have the right to appeal to a French
language Tribunal is mandated in OSET's original Order-In-Council.</p>
<p>To ensure that members are up-to-date on their mandate and the administrative
justice system's expectation of them as adjudicators and/or mediators, in the fall of
2010, OSET finalized its <em>Guide to the Tribunal Process</em> and the <em>Mediation Guide</em>.
Members are provided with training on their content to ensure that they are ready to
undertake their adjudicative tasks. These documents are a key part of OSET's
succession planning.</p>
<p>In accordance with the previous year's Business Plan, during 2010-11 OSET held
two all members' meetings. One was held in June 2010, and the other was
synchronized with the Conference of Ontario Boards and Agencies conference in
November 2010, which all members attended. Individual members also attended
several relevant workshops, organized by the Ministry of Education and the Society
of Ontario Adjudicators and Regulators. Two members participated in training and
received certification as mediators. In accordance with the OSET's accountability
practices, all members are provided with a written report on the contents of such
conferences, workshops and training programs.</p>

<h3 id="oset-5">Responding to and compliance with new legislation</h3>
<p>OSET, as a public body, complies with the legislation that governs administrative
tribunals in Ontario. During 2010-2011, much of OSET's focus was on ensuring and
enhancing this compliance, as listed below:</p>
<ol>
<li>OSET developed an Accessibility and Accommodation Policy and as a result
complies with the Customer Service Standard, developed under the
<em>Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act</em>, 2006.</li>
<li>All documents and materials on the website have been reviewed and were
appropriately adjusted to ensure compliance.</li>
<li>OSET developed a Freedom of Information policy and protocol, in cooperation
with the Ministry of Education, its former host ministry. This was
finalized in April 2010.</li>
</ol>


<h3 id="oset-6">Decisions</h3>

<p>All Special Education Tribunal decisions are anonymized before they are made
public and posted on the Tribunal's website at <a href="/oset/">tribunalsontario.ca/oset</a>. The parties
receive the decisions with the identifying information retained.</p>

<h5>S. v. Halton Catholic District
School Board (DSB)</h5>
<p>In <em>S. v. Halton Catholic District
School Board (DSB)</em>, a secondary
school student was identified as both
gifted and dyslexic. The Tribunal
ordered a revised identification and
the board complied. The student's
placement is in a regular class with
resource withdrawal. In that
placement, the board is expected to
provide specific programming,
services and accommodation to
meet the student's dual
exceptionality. The parents
complained that the board did not
comply with the orders regarding the
student's exceptionality-specific
programming. The Tribunal issued a
supplementary decision, confirming
that the parents' complaint regarding
non-compliance had merit as far as
the student's gifted identification was
concerned. A one-day
supplementary hearing was held and
the Tribunal issued a further
decision, ordering the board to
provide or purchase an appropriate
program for the student, in
accordance with its legislated
mandate.</p>

<h5>R. v. Halton DSB</h5>
<p>In <em>R. v. Halton DSB</em>, a secondary
school student was identified with
developmental disabilities and had
been out of school for much of the
2009-2010 school year. At the time
of the hearing, the student was not
attending school. The parents wanted
the Tribunal to remove the student's
identification as an exceptional student
and to order the board to provide a
placement in a regular Grade 9 class, so
that the student could eventually
graduate and go on to post-secondary
education.</p>
<p>The Tribunal issued an interim decision
to ensure the student's return to school
at the earliest opportunity. It ordered the
board to identify the student as
exceptional without a specific
exceptionality designation, pending the
student undergoing an assessment to
determine what exceptionality is the
most appropriate. The Tribunal also
ordered the board to arrange the
assessment and to place the student in
a special education program full time,
until the assessment has been carried
out and an IPRC can determine the
most appropriate identification and
placement.</p>

<h2 id="sbt">SOCIAL BENEFITS TRIBUNAL</h2>

<h3 id="sbt-1">Associate Chair's Messages</h3>

<p><em><strong>Gary Yee, Associate Chair &emsp; Alternate Executive Chair</strong>
<br>Social Benefits Tribunal Social &emsp; Justice Tribunals Ontario</em></p>

<p>The Social Benefits Tribunal became part of Social Justice Tribunals Ontario on
January 25, 2011. As the fiscal year ended, a new administrative justice organization
began. Michael Gottheil was appointed as the Executive Chair of the cluster, and in
March of this year, the Chairs of the seven tribunals that comprise the cluster
received new appointments as Associate Chairs of their respective tribunals. It is
exciting to play a part in the creation of the cluster, and to contribute to the fulfilment
of the potential and promise that is seen in the clustering of tribunals.</p>
<p>As the Chair and then Associate Chair of the Social Benefits Tribunal, I feel a sense
of good fortune and tremendous pride to be leading this Tribunal. I see examples
every day of the dedication and expertise of its members and staff. The tribunal
world occupies a special place within the public service. We are drawn together by
our common goal of fair and accessible dispute resolution, our passion for justice,
and our awareness of the impact of our decisions on everyday lives.</p>
<p>In last year's Annual Report, we expressed our commitment to building an
accountable, predictable and proactive tribunal. In pursuit of this goal, the main
priorities for 2010 - 2011 were to review all aspects of how the Tribunal schedules its
hearings and to expand opportunities for early resolution without a full hearing. The
Tribunal focused much of the past fiscal year on actively promoting - to members,
staff and counsel - the goal of predictability in scheduling. Scheduling timeframe
guidelines were put in place after internal and external consultation. A series of
Communiqu&eacute;s were sent out to all of our stakeholders with reminders or information
about the changes in our procedures. One of the measurable results of our
organized and strategic action in this area was a decline of 37% from the previous
fiscal year in the number of hearings that had to be rescheduled.</p>
<p>In the area of proactive case management and dispute resolution, the Tribunal reinstituted
its Early Resolution Program (ERP) in February 2011. The ERP process
generally involves a telephone call between the two parties and the Tribunal's
Appeal Resolution Officer (ARO), who acts as a facilitator to discuss possible ways
to resolve the appeal without the need for a full hearing.</p>
<p>The Tribunal continues to have a constructive and cooperative relationship with the
representatives of the appellants and the respondents. All stakeholders have
essential roles to play in the tribunal's quest to be more accountable for its quality
and productivity. A tribunal needs effective communication channels with its
stakeholders in order to maximize the benefits of the tribunal's predictability.
Ongoing communication with stakeholders is essential to develop and implement
proactive approaches to case management and dispute resolution.</p>
<p>The SBT Consultative Committee was established and it held its first meeting in
June 2010, followed by two more meetings during the fiscal year. This Committee
discusses operational and procedural matters with representatives of appellants and
respondents. I am grateful to the members of the Committee for their contributions in
identifying and resolving major concerns and promoting best practices within the
Tribunal.</p>
<p>In the coming year, while clustering will define the directions and identities of the
clustered tribunals, each tribunal will continue to respond flexibly and effectively in
order to carry out their individual legislative mandates. The new cluster brings great
potential for building more accountable, predictable and proactive tribunals - utilizing
the power of strategic and selective integration, through sharing resources (facilities,
members, staff), improving best practices, increasing opportunities for professional
development, and fostering more consistent approaches. In addition to contributing
to the success of the cluster, the Social Benefits Tribunal will build on the strong
gains that we have made on improving scheduling predictability, and we will
continue to expand the work that has already been started on early resolution.</p>
<p>The year ahead promises to be eventful and exciting, and I look forward to working
with everyone towards our common goal of providing fair and accessible dispute
resolution.</p>

<h3 id="sbt-2">Role of the Tribunal</h3>
<p>The Social Benefits Tribunal is an independent tribunal that considers appeals by
applicants for and recipients of social assistance who disagree with a decision that
affects the amount of or their eligibility for social assistance. It was established in
1998 under Part IV of the <em>Ontario Works Act, 1997</em>. Appeals are heard under that
Act and the <em>Ontario Disability Support Program Act, 1997</em>. The Tribunal has
Members who are appointed by Order-in-Council. It is supported by legal counsel
and administrative staff. The Tribunal's head office is in Toronto, with regional offices
in London, Ottawa and Hamilton. In January 2011, the Social Benefits Tribunal
became part of Social Justice Tribunals Ontario.</p>
<p>The Tribunal conducts hearings throughout Ontario. Because of the sensitive
personal information involved in these cases, the legislation provides that all
hearings must be held in private. Most hearings are conducted by a panel consisting
of one member. The parties to the appeal are the appellant (the person who is
appealing the decision of the ODSP or OW office) and the respondent (the Director
of the ODSP or the municipal administrator of OW).</p>
<p>Most of the appeals before the Tribunal are about whether the appellant meets the
definition of a person with a disability under the <em>Ontario Disability Support Program
Act</em>. Other appeals are about many different issues - examples include whether the
appellant is meeting all the requirements to look for work under the <em>Ontario Works
Act</em>, or whether the appellant reported income or other information that is required by
law to be reported. The Tribunal also considers issues regarding human rights as
part of its mandate.</p>

<h3 id="sbt-3">The Year in Review</h3>

<h4>Performance Highlights - Statistics</h4>
<p>In the fiscal year 2010-2011, the Tribunal built on its success of the previous year.
The Tribunal received 12,159 appeals in 2010-2011, which is a slight increase of 3%
(379 appeals) compared to the previous fiscal year. The Tribunal completed 12,388
appeals, which exceeded the number of new appeals received, leading to a decline
in the Tribunal's pending inventory. The overall average case processing time
decreased to 8.7 months compared to 9.8 months the previous year. This resulted
from more efficient and predictable scheduling practices.</p>

<h4>Scheduling</h4>
<p>In the previous fiscal year, the Tribunal established scheduling timeframe guidelines
to provide parties with enough notice of a hearing so that they would have a
reasonable time to prepare. This is especially important in hearings where the issue
is whether an appellant is a person with a disability, since there is a regulation that
prohibits adjourning such hearings for the purpose of obtaining additional medical
reports.</p>
<p>In implementing these timeframe guidelines, it was necessary for the Tribunal to
undergo a comprehensive review of its overall scheduling practices. The review
included consultation with staff and external stakeholders to assess current practices
and seek their input for improvement. This review resulted in the implementation of
best practices for scheduling. A key element of the best practices included
increasing the notice period for the first hearing to about six months. This was done
to ensure consistency and to allow the Tribunal to fully schedule hearings into every
available hearing slot while at the same time reducing the number of rescheduled
hearings and adjournments. This resulted in increased scheduling predictability and
positive feedback from representatives of appellants and respondents. The Tribunal
reduced the number of hearings that had to be rescheduled by 37%, which meant
that 2,000 fewer hearings were rescheduled in 2010-2011 compared to the previous
fiscal year.</p>
<p>The Tribunal began working on revising Practice Direction 4 - Rescheduling of
Hearings and Adjournments. This revision involves internal and external
consultation, and it will reflect the changes that have been made in the improved
practices of the Tribunal in this area.</p>

<h4>Early Resolution Program</h4>
<p>In keeping with the Tribunal's goal to be predictable and proactive, the SBT reinstituted
the Early Resolution Program (ERP) in February 2011. It was first
implemented in 2006, but it has not been fully utilized in the past couple of years.
After intensive refresher training for staff, regular early resolution sessions for
selected cases began in March 2011. The ERP process usually involves a telephone
call between the two parties and the Tribunal's Appeal Resolution Officer (ARO),
who acts as a facilitator to discuss possible ways to resolve the appeal without the
need for a full hearing. The Tribunal already has a Practice Direction for the ERP, as
well as a Practice Tips document. While the Program was developed with an initial
focus on suitable Ontario Works (OW) cases, the Tribunal plans to expand the
selection of cases to include suitable Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP)
cases.</p>

<h4>Information Technology</h4>
<p>Over the course of the last fiscal year, the Tribunal has made great strides in our
continuing efforts to expand our technological capabilities. The Tribunal's caseload
management system, including the reporting and letter generating application, was
upgraded towards the end of the fiscal year. These upgrades not only increased our
overall workload efficiency but also have greatly assisted our ability to monitor and
improve our scheduling practices. In cooperation with stakeholders, the Tribunal also
initiated a two-month pilot project for the use of the Electronic Attachment Transfer
Service (EATS), which permits secure electronic filing of private documents with
municipalities and legal clinics. With the Ontario Government's Green Initiative in place, the Tribunal continues to explore ways to shift towards electronic filing and
electronic file transfers, which will decrease our dependency on paper, while
increasing our effectiveness in distributing documents to both Tribunal personnel
and parties or representatives.</p>

<h4>Adjudication Strategies - Human Rights Cases</h4>
<p>The Social Benefits Tribunal continued to adopt various adjudication strategies when
dealing with human right cases, rather than simply dealing with them on an ad hoc
or case by case basis.</p>
<p>The SBT continued to provide ongoing training to members on human rights, both in
substance and best procedural practices. In the context of the social justice tribunals
cluster, the SBT will benefit from sharing resources and expertise with the Human
Rights Tribunal of Ontario.</p>
<p>Pre-hearing conferences held prior to a Stage 2 hearing have been very valuable.
These conferences allow the issues to be narrowed, witnesses and evidence to be
confirmed, and timeframe expectations to be set. This enables more predictable
scheduling of the Stage 2 hearing and a more proactive and focused hearing.</p>
<p>The final decision in the case of <em>Ontario (Disability Support Program, Director) v.
Tranchemontagne</em>, 324 D. L. R. (4th) 87 Ont. C.A. meant that a Stage 2 hearing for a
<em>Human Rights Code</em> challenge was no longer needed in alcoholism or addiction
cases. The SBT contacted parties whose cases were on hold pending the decision
of the Ontario Court of Appeal. Many of those cases ended up being resolved
without any further hearing by the SBT.</p>
<p>As an additional adjudication strategy, the SBT tried to ensure that human rights
cases involving significant emerging legal issues or similar subject matter would be
heard reasonably near to each other in time. Although fact situations often differ, this
approach assists the SBT in building up its jurisprudence in a variety of areas.</p>
<p>The SBT continued to work with stakeholders to handle the more than 500 cases
where appellants have submitted that the legislation governing special diet
allowance cases contravened the <em>Human Rights Code</em>. Please refer to the Notable
Decisions section for a SBT decision that adopted the analysis set out by the Human
Rights Tribunal of Ontario in dealing with these special diet cases. The SBT plans to
write to all appellants to remind them of what they will need to produce in the way of
evidence as their cases move forward.</p>

<h4>Accessibility Initiatives</h4>
<p>In the past year, the Tribunal continued to monitor its policies and procedures, and
complied with its new Customer Service Policy, to ensure that persons with
disabilities have equal opportunity to access services and achieve the same benefit from services in a similar manner to other participants in the appeal process. This is
part of meeting our commitments under the <em>Accessibility for Ontarians with
Disabilities Act, 2005</em>, [AODA], and its regulations. The Tribunal's work in this area is
particularly important because the vast majority of the appellants are applicants or
recipients under the <em>Ontario Disability Support Program Act, 1997</em>. As a member of
Social Justice Tribunals Ontario, the Tribunal looks forward to participating in the
implementation of the new Integrated Accessibility Standards regulation under the
AODA, which will provide standards in the areas of information and communications;
employment; and transportation.</p>

<h4>Professional Development</h4>
<p>Focused and timely professional development for members and staff is important for
every tribunal. In addition, the Tribunal also recognizes the value in staff and
members coming together to share information about substantive, procedural and
strategic issues. This sharing of best practices and expertise will be greatly
enhanced with the clustering of social justice tribunals.</p>
<p>In this past year, Social Benefits Tribunal staff and members participated in a review
of natural justice and procedural fairness principles. Additional staff training included
dispute resolution training to support the Tribunal's reintegration of the Early
Resolution Program, human rights procedures training, and training on changes in
the Tribunal's adjournment and rescheduling practices.</p>
<p>The Tribunal's members from across the province gathered in Toronto for a three
day annual training conference in April 2010. Further member training occurred
throughout the year in a series of regularly scheduled mini-teleconference sessions
on a broad range of procedural and substantive topics, including reviews of new
relevant case law and changes to legislation. Almost all of the training is provided inhouse
by the Tribunal's legal unit, with members and staff assisting as needed.</p>

<h4>French Language Services</h4>
<p>The Social Benefits Tribunal continued the work undertaken last year to improve and
promote the delivery of its services in French, and meet its commitments under the
<em>French Language Services Act</em>. The Tribunal posted its commitment to French
Language Services on its website. There was further training and sharing of best
practices for staff and members in regards to handling files and hearings in French
language appeals. The Tribunal continued to ensure adequate levels of bilingual
staffing.</p>
<p>The Tribunal also commenced work on two procedures that will positively impact the
delivery of French language services. One is a complaint procedure which includes
complaints regarding French language services. The other is a new practice
direction on the process for French language appeals. These procedures may be coordinated with cluster-wide initiatives in this area as the new social justice tribunals cluster develops.</p>

<h4>Communication and Stakeholder Engagement</h4>
<p>The Social Benefits Tribunal continued to maintain its commitment to actively
engage its stakeholders, as an important part of becoming a more accountable,
predictable and proactive tribunal.</p>
<p>In June 2010, the Tribunal held the first meeting of the new SBT Consultative
Committee. This was followed by two more Committee meetings for the fiscal year.
The committee membership includes both senior and operational level
representatives from the Social Benefits Tribunal; Ministry of Community and Social
Services; municipal Ontario Works offices; and legal clinic representatives of
appellants. It has been a constructive and productive process with a great exchange
of information resulting in positive changes in the areas of scheduling, adjournment
and rescheduling practises.</p>
<p>The Tribunal continued its use of the SBT E-Mail Communication List to send out
regular SBT Communiqu&eacute;s quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>The Tribunal also continued to participate in various stakeholder events, such as
presentations at the Case Presenting Officers Professional Development Day in
April 2010, the Ontario Native Welfare Administrator's Association Conference in
October 2010 and the Northern Region Legal Clinics Training Conference also in
October 2010.</p>

<h3 id="sbt-5">Performance Targets</h3>
<p>The Social Benefits Tribunal is continually monitoring its performance, and
developing strategies and processes to become a more accountable, predictable
and proactive tribunal.</p>
<p>In the coming fiscal year, the Social Benefits Tribunal looks forward to working
closely with the other tribunals in Social Justice Tribunals Ontario to contribute to the
successful implementation of the cluster. In addition, the Social Benefits Tribunal will
build on the strong gains that we have made on improving scheduling predictability -
this includes revising Practice Direction 4 on Rescheduling of Hearings and
Adjournments. The Tribunal will also continue to expand the work that has already
been started on early resolution - we will work with our stakeholders to maximize the
effectiveness of the Early Resolution Program (ERP), and to explore how to expand
this to ODSP and other types of appeals.</p>
<p>Another major area of activity will be the decisions initiative that has been started.
The Tribunal will find ways to increase public access to anonymized versions of the
decisions and to establish standards for the quality of decisions and reasons.</p>
<p>In addition to these initiatives that are focused on quality, the Tribunal will continue
to compile statistical reports to monitor productivity, detect trends and assist in
managing the Tribunal. We will be working with the cluster to develop a more
comprehensive set of service standards. This will build on current internal
benchmarks for service, timeliness and productivity, and will include legislated
timeframes that are imposed on the Tribunal (for example, the 60-day timeframe for
releasing a decision). The Tribunal will establish numerical targets such as case
processing time.</p>
<p>Performance measurement for adjudicative tribunals is one of the most challenging
areas in administrative justice. But it is essential to meet the demands and
expectations for greater accountability and better service. The Social Benefits
Tribunal looks forward to working within the new SJTO cluster to develop
coordinated performance targets and strategic priorities.</p>

<h3 id="sbt-6">Decisions</h3>

<h4 style="display:none;">Social Benefits Tribunal</h4>
<!--no actual h4 but i need to use h5 style for the next headings -->

<p><h5>Board and Lodging or Rental</h5>
(SBT
File # 0910-08824, July 6, 2010)</p>
<p>This appeal required the Tribunal to
decide whether the appellant resided
in a board and lodging or rental
situation. The appellant was a
person with a disability residing with
his parents.</p>
<p>The Tribunal determined that the
appellant lived in a board and
lodging situation. The fact that the
appellant was learning to select and
independently prepare his food did
not change the fact that he was
receiving his lodging and food from
the same source, his mother.</p>
<p>The concept of tenancy includes an
element of exclusive possession of
the premises separating the rights of
the tenant to occupy a premise from
the ownership rights of the landlord.
In this case there was no such
distinction. The appellant and his
family lived together in the family
home owned by his parents.</p>

<p><h5>Overpayments and the Social
Assistance Review Board and
Social Benefits Tribunal</h5> (SBT File
# 0911-09826, August 11, 2010)</p>
<p>This case is about two separate
overpayments and whether the
appellant had a right of appeal with
respect to either one. The
overpayments were assessed by the
Director under the <em>Family Benefits
Act</em> and for this reason the appeals
were scheduled before a member
who was cross-appointed to both the
Social Assistance Review Board
(SARB) and Social Benefits Tribunal
(SBT).</p>
<p>The first overpayment was assessed by
the Director under the <em>Family Benefits
Act</em> in 1999. This overpayment was
appealed to the SARB in 2000. At the
SARB hearing, the Board upheld the
decision to assess the overpayment but
overturned the overpayment calculation
and referred it back to the Director for a
new calculation, which it ordered would
constitute a new decision. The Board
clarified that a 1999 file review that had
disclosed a second overpayment in
1998 was not part of the appeal before
the Board at that time.</p>
<p>In 2009, the appellant received a letter
from Ontario Works regarding an
outstanding balance owing on the 1999
overpayments. She filed an appeal with
the SBT. The Tribunal determined that it
had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal in
relation to the first overpayment: the
question of whether the appellant was
overpaid had already been decided by
SARB. The SARB decision was never
challenged and was a final and binding
decision. Although ordered to do so, the
Director never recalculated the amount
of the overpayment and therefore, there
was no new decision to appeal. The
SBT found that the 2009 letter from
Ontario Works was not a decision letter
as contemplated by the legislation;
rather, it was in the order of a collection
letter regarding an outstanding debt.
The result was a final SARB decision
that the appellant was overpaid, but no
new decision on the amount of that
overpayment. In the unusual
circumstances, the Administrator
indicated that the appellant would receive an arrears payment for the
overpayment recovery that had
happened.</p>
<p>Regarding the second 1998
overpayment, the Tribunal
determined that while the
overpayment had not been part of
the earlier SARB appeal and
therefore was not barred for that
reason, nevertheless it would not
consider it. The Tribunal was
satisfied that the 2009 collection
letter was not the first time that the
appellant knew about the 1999
overpayment. The appellant had
received notice of the overpayment
in a variety of ways over 10 years,
including the discussion at the SARB
hearing in 2000, and had failed to
take any step to question the
overpayment.</p>

<p><h5>Tribunal's Human Rights Code
procedure</h5> (SBT File # 0510-
08309R, May 11, 2010)</p>
<p>The Tribunal determined that the
appellant was not a person with a
disability. The appellant requested a
reconsideration hearing and argued
that the decision discriminated, and
in particular, failed to consider the
application of the principles in the
Supreme Court of Canada decision
in <em>Tranchemontagne v. Ontario
(Disability Support Program)</em>, [2006]
SCC 14, and the "primacy of the
appellant's human rights." The
Tribunal denied the reconsideration
request on the merits of the appeal
and then, according to its practice
governing human rights issues,
asked the appellant to provide
particulars of his human rights issue.</p>
<p>The Director challenged the Tribunal's
right to proceed on two grounds: (1) that
the Tribunal was <em>functus officio</em> when it
issued its decision on the merits of the
appeal and therefore the appellant was
too late to raise a human rights
challenge; and (2) the appellant had
failed to provide sufficient particulars of
the Code challenge, and more
specifically, had failed to adequately
identify the area and grounds of
discrimination and the evidence to be
relied on.</p>
<p>The Tribunal's Practice Direction 6 on
Human Rights Issues allows a human
rights challenge to be raised at the time
the appeal is filed or during the appeal
process. The Tribunal ruled that part of
the appeal process includes the right to
request a reconsideration hearing, and
therefore, in raising the Code challenge
as part of the reconsideration request
the requirements of the Practice
Direction had been met. The appeal was
however dismissed because the
appellant failed to provide sufficient
particulars of his Code challenge. The
appellant's dissatisfaction with the
decision on the merits and
characterizing it as unfair and
discriminatory was not a human rights
argument and could not be used as an
alternate route to challenge the merits of
the appeal. Although the appellant
framed this as a Code discrimination
challenge, the thrust of the submission
was that the Tribunal had erred in its
decision to find that the appellant was
not disabled.</p>

<p><h5>Interim Order directing procedure for
hearing of human rights Code
challenges to the special diet
provisions</h5> (SBT File # 0701-00262,
January 10, 2011)</p>
<p>This is an interim order of the
Tribunal regarding the Tribunal's
procedure to hear a <em>Human Rights
Code</em> challenge to the special diet
provisions in the Ontario Disability
Support Program legislation. The
appellant in this case alleges that the
special diet program under the
ODSPA discriminates against him as
compared to others with different
disabilities because he has
disabilities that require special diets
that are either not funded or are
inadequately funded as compared to
individuals with other disabilities.</p>
<p>On February 17, 2010 the Human
Rights Tribunal of Ontario (HRTO)
released its lead decision in <em>Ball v.
Ontario (Community and Social
Services)</em>, 2010 HRTO 360,
regarding the special diet allowance.
In response to this decision, the
Social Benefits Tribunal decided to
implement an adjudication strategy
for dealing with its caseload of over
500 special diet appeals raising
human rights challenges. The
appellant opted out of this case
management stream. At a prehearing
conference, the parties as
represented by Legal Aid Ontario,
the Income Security Advocacy
Centre, a community legal clinic and
counsel from Constitutional Law
Branch of the Ministry of the Attorney
General agreed that this appeal
would move forward as a test case
to determine if the Social Benefits
Tribunal would adopt the legal
analysis applied by the HRTO in the
<em>Ball</em> decision.</p>
<p>The Social Benefits Tribunal
determined that the reasoning and
legal analysis in the <em>Ball</em> decision should
be applied to special diet appeals filed
with the Tribunal, as it establishes a
useful guideline for notifying this
appellant and other appellants about the
necessary evidence to produce to
establish a successful claim of
discrimination, and that appellants
would benefit from knowing what would
be expected of them in terms of
particularizing their claims.</p>

<p><h5>Human rights Code challenge -
marital status</h5> (SBT File # 0405-
03455R, April 23, 2010)</p>
<p>The Director assessed an overpayment
of $60,000 caused by business and
inheritance income and assets in excess
of the allowable limit. The appellants
appealed the decision to the Tribunal
and challenged several sections of the
ODSPA under the <em>Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms</em>. The Tribunal
ruled that it lacked jurisdiction to hear
the charter issue. The appellants
appealed the ruling to the Divisional
Court but eventually withdrew the
appeal. The matter came back before
the Tribunal for a hearing on the merits,
as well as a challenge that the Director's
decision contravened the marital status
protections of the <em>Human Rights Code</em>.</p>
<p>The Director's decision on the merits
was upheld and the Tribunal then turned
to consider the Code issue. The
appellants alleged that, because they
were married, they were unfairly forced
to include income and assets of the
husband in assessing the wife's
financial eligibility as a disabled recipient
of ODSP. The Tribunal found that
including the husband in the "benefit
unit" of the disabled person was not
discriminatory: it does not treat married members of the benefit unit
differently than non-married
members in comparable
circumstances.</p>
<p>The Tribunal further found that any
distinction drawn between ODSP
recipients who inherit assets by way
of trust and those ODSP recipients
who inherit assets not held in trust
cannot be said to be a Code-based
distinction and thus did not constitute
discrimination under the Code.</p>

<p><h5>Assets held in trust</h5> (SBT File #
0811-09925, May 25, 2010)</p>
<p>To be eligible for income support a
disabled person must not have
assets that exceed the prescribed
limit unless the assets are exempt.
Purposively assigning or transferring
assets in order to become eligible for
support can justify a reduction or
cancellation of support.</p>
<p>The appellant received an
inheritance of over $200,000. The
appellant's sister agreed to manage
the money for the appellant and
sought legal advice, which resulted
in the funds being placed in a trust
fund. The appellant's sister was the
trustee and she had sole discretion
in using the funds for the appellant's
benefit.</p>
<p>The Tribunal determined that the
asset was not exempt and that the
appellant became ineligible to
receive income support at the time
that he received his inheritance in
the form of a cheque.</p>
<p>The Tribunal found the following
factors significant: the will by which
the appellant inherited did not include
any provision precluding the appellant
from accessing the funds directly, there
was no provision in the will suggesting
that funds be held in trust if a beneficiary
were found incompetent to manage
them, and no evidence led to suggest
that the appellant had been found to be
incompetent. The Tribunal concluded
that the wording of the will and the
remainder wording of the trust
document, as well as the testimony of
the appellant and his sister, presented a
consistent description of circumstances
in which the funds were not only
accessible to, but given by way of
cheque directly to the appellant, who
then agreed with his sister to seek a
legal means of protecting them from
infringing on his receipt of ODSP
benefits.</p>

<p><h5>Direct and cumulative effect of an
impairment results in a substantial
restriction in activities of daily living</h5>
(SBT File # 0910-08884, November 19,
2010)</p>
<p>The appellant applied for income
support under the <em>Ontario Disability
Support Program Act</em> as a person with a
disability. Her doctor listed conditions
and impairments in the Disability
Determination Package, (DDP);
however, the column for restrictions in
daily living was left blank. The appellant
obtained further information from the
doctor. The Director's representative
argued that because the additional
medical information was in a letter and
not in chart form as provided in the
DDP, there was no way to determine
which impairment resulted in which
restriction, and that this was a
requirement of the legislative test.
Subsection 4(1)(b) of the Act requires a determination that the direct and
cumulative effect of the impairment
results in a substantial restriction in
one of the activities of daily living.
The Tribunal found that it could
consider restrictions set out in the
doctor's additional report despite the
fact that they were not tied to a
specific impairment. Relying on
decisions of the Court of Appeal and
the Divisional Court, the Tribunal
confirmed that not all details need be
provided once the existence of the
impairments and the restrictions had
been verified. In the Tribunal's view,
the approach advocated by the
Director's representative placed
undue emphasis on the term "direct"
effect and would render the
requirement to consider the
"cumulative" effect meaningless.</p>

<p><h5>Verification of impairments and
restrictions</h5> (SBT File # 1002-
01332, October 1, 2010)</p>
<p>In an appeal of the Director's
decision to deny eligibility as a
person with a disability, a preliminary
issue was raised as to which
impairments and restrictions the
Tribunal would consider at the hearing.
The appellant had submitted additional
medical information from the doctor in
the form of several charts, which listed
additional conditions, impairments and
restrictions. The appellant requested the
Tribunal consider comments listed
under "impairments" as referring to
"restrictions" and to accept other
comments as referring to impairments.</p>
<p>The Tribunal determined that
impairments/restrictions need not only
be found in the areas designated in the
forms; however, they must still meet the
legislative requirements in subsection
4(1) of the Act. The onus remains on the
appellant to show that the decision of
the Director was incorrect. The Tribunal
agreed that "impairments" and
"restrictions" are distinct concepts.
Impairments refer to problems in body
function or structure, while restrictions
refer to difficulties an individual may
have in executing activities. For
example, the Tribunal found that the
term "arthritis" did not constitute or make
plain a significant loss or deviation and
could not be considered an impairment.</p>
