<div class="box"><strong>Message from Michael Gottheil, Executive Chair</strong>
<br><em>Social Justice Tribunals Ontario</em></div>
<br>

<p>I am proud of the accomplishments of SJTO, and its role in the administration of
justice in Ontario. We provide fair, accessible dispute resolution to thousands of
Ontarians each year. In 2013-14 alone, our tribunals received and resolved more
than 100,000 cases. Over the past year we also focused on boosting capacity and
expertise, looking for ways to work more efficiently, and collaborating with our
justice sector partners.</p>
<p>Because of the breadth of our jurisdiction and the nature of the disputes we deal
with, our users are extremely varied. We resolve disputes between landlords and
tenants, hear appeals from people seeking social assistance and complaints from
those who feel the service they received from children's aid societies has been
unfair. We deal with applications about human rights and the rights of children and
families relating to education. These are important issues that touch the lives of
families and individuals in fundamental ways. The public and the parties who
appear before the SJTO tribunals have a right to fair, impartial and expert dispute
resolution, and that is our primary commitment.</p>
<p>A high percentage of our users are people with disabilities, individuals who face
literacy, language and communication barriers, and persons who experience social
and economic disadvantage. Overwhelmingly, the parties who appear before the
SJTO tribunals are self-represented. This means our processes, procedures and
the way we resolve disputes must be sensitive to the needs of the people who
seek our services.</p>
<p>We continue to work on ways to improve access to information and to our services.
In 2014-15 we will launch a new website. The site will provide users with
information that is easy to find and easy to understand. People who use screen
readers will also find the new site easier to navigate. Also, following
recommendations made by Andrew Pinto in his <a href="http://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/english/about/pubs/human_rights/Pinto_human_rights_report_2012-ENG.pdf" target="_blank">Report of the Human Rights
Review 2012</a>, we have modified the information and forms of the Human Rights
Tribunal of Ontario to make them easier to use.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, we will be introducing e-filing at the Landlord and Tenant Board. Efiling
will allow users to file anytime from anywhere and provide guided steps for
both landlords and tenants. Also at the Landlord and Tenant Board, we are
beginning to develop an online wizard which will help users find answers they need
more easily. Referrals to existing legal and community resources are being built
into the tool.</p>
<p>SJTO has also developed a policy which lays out how we will provide
accommodation for persons with disabilities. One of our commitments is to publish
information on the accessibility features at each SJTO hearing location so that people can research what is available ahead of their hearing. The policy also
establishes accommodation co-ordinators for each tribunal - staff who have
training in accommodation, and can be a single, knowledgeable point of contact for
users who require accommodation. Watch for that information to appear on our
website later in 2014-15.</p>
<p>To uphold the highest standards of integrity and quality of adjudication, we
continue to develop our professional development program. Our annual
educational event, called "The Institute" was last held in May 2013 and covered
topics like evidence, decision writing, early resolution, mediation
and communication in the hearing room. The Institute is also an opportunity for
SJTO members and mediators to share their skills, experiences, and perspectives,
and to enrich their expertise. In 2014, our professional development unit also
created and delivered a training module on human rights to all tribunals.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, the SJTO is a part of the justice system in Ontario, and we have a
responsibility to respond to the challenges the sector faces. This past year saw the
release of a number of important reports on Access to Justice, including the
<a href="http://www.cfcj-fcjc.org/sites/default/files/docs/2013/AC_Report_English_Final.pdf" target="_blank">National Action Committee Report on Access to Civil and Family Justice</a> and the
Canadian Bar Association's report: <a href="http://www.lsuc.on.ca/uploadedFiles/For_the_Public/About_the_Law_Society/Convocation_Decisions/2014/CBA_equal_justice.pdf" target="_blank">Reaching Equal Justice</a>. Both reports highlight
the challenges we face in access to justice, and provide recommendations.</p>
<p>At SJTO, we have been working with justice sector partners to meet these
challenges. For example, we have begun to work on a project with legal clinics and
the Ministry of Community and Social Services to streamline the process for social
assistance appeals. Also at the Social Benefits Tribunal, we are discussing ways to
facilitate limited retainers and unbundled legal services. This allows legal clinics to
serve more people and make more strategic decisions about how to allocate
limited resources.</p>
<p>At the Landlord and Tenant Board, we are working with social housing providers to
develop approaches to dispute resolution which better fit the needs of social
housing landlords and their tenants by enhancing access to mediation and
including community support workers in the mediation and resolution process.
At the Child and Family Services Review Board, we are borrowing from the
aboriginal community to introduce restorative justice techniques. This approach
has obvious benefit for our aboriginal users, but has been received with excitement
and promise from non-aboriginal users, as the nature of family disputes and
disputes with children's aid societies lend themselves to more collaborative and
restorative approaches.</p>
<p>While these initiatives are exciting, we know that ultimately, their success depends
upon whether they are truly effective and responsive to user needs. As a result, we
have launched a project to develop an evaluation framework which will help us
assess our organizational strength against common justice sector benchmarks and
also seek feedback from our users. Lilian Ma, Landlord and Tenant Board Associate Chair, has been assigned to this important project, and we expect an evaluation framework later this year.</p>
<p>Finally, I have a few announcements about the SJTO team. First, I am very
pleased to announce that Yola Grant joined SJTO as the Associate Chair for the
Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario on April 16, 2014. Yola was a labour,
employment and human rights lawyer with Grant & Bernhardt and held a number
of policy and legal positions in the public sector including counsel at the Pay Equity
and Employment Equity tribunals, and the predecessor to the HRTO, the Board of
Inquiry. I have to thank Naomi Overend who did an outstanding job acting as
Associate Chair of the tribunal during the recruitment period.</p>
<p>I also want to warmly thank Kim Bugby, who has taken on the role of Coordinating
Vice Chair of the Landlord and Tenant Board, while the board's Associate Chair,
Lillian Ma, leads our evaluation framework project.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to thank all the adjudicators on each of our tribunals for their
professionalism and dedication to fair, accessible dispute resolution. I am proud to
work with all of you.</p>

<div class="box"><strong>Message from Ellen Wexler, Executive Lead</strong>
<br><em>Social Justice Tribunals Ontario</em></div>
<br>

<p>I am proud to submit this annual report. It reminds me of how much we have
accomplished at SJTO this year and I'm excited about what's in store in the year
ahead.
Service excellence is a priority for Social Justice Tribunals Ontario. To that end, on
April 1, 2012, we introduced service standards which tell people how long they can
expect it will take for their hearing or mediation to be scheduled and heard in each
of SJTO's seven tribunals. The standards keep us focused on providing our clients
with fair, effective, timely dispute resolution, even as we adapt to legislative change
and adopt new technologies.
This year, we reported on how we are doing in meeting those standards. In most
instances we met or exceeded the standards but in some cases, we fell short.
Having standards in place means that we know when and where we need to
improve so we can start finding solutions. You can review the service standards
results under each of the tribunal headings in this report and on <a href="/en/reports-plans-standards">our website</a>.</p>

<p>We are committed to the active offer of French language services for
Francophones across Ontario. SJTO's new <a href="/en/french-language-services/">policy on French language services</a> means that clients seeking services in French know what they can expect from any
SJTO tribunal. The policy promises that our frontline services and documents like
publications, forms, notices and rules will be available in French. We also commit
to providing bilingual adjudicators and mediators on request, or, in cases where
one is not available, an interpreter.</p>
<p>Accessibility, diversity and inclusion are core values of SJTO. This year we
demonstrated our commitment through a number of initiatives that are outlined in
the report, including new policies, improved information and training.
Another priority for the SJTO is co-location. In June of 2013, we announced that
we would be moving our downtown Toronto offices to 25 Grosvenor St. in Toronto.
The relocation will begin in early 2016 and I look forward to having our tribunals
under one roof. It will allow us to truly realize the benefits of clustering by sharing
knowledge, expertise, space and equipment.</p>
<p>On the human resources front, we replaced three directors of case management
with an SJTO Director of Operations, who ensures a coordinated approach to
operations across the cluster. Each tribunal also has a registrar and front line
managers, who provide leadership on case-management, administration and dayto-day
operations.</p>
<p>There are a lot of innovative things going on in SJTO tribunals. To improve service
delivery and reduce costs, tribunals shared hearing space and used video technology for more mediations and hearings. We have put a renewed focus on
alternative dispute resolution methods including mediation. You'll find more about
these initiatives in the operational highlights section of each tribunal.</p>
<p>I would like to extend a special thank you to all of the staff and members at SJTO.
Every year, we resolve over 100,000 disputes. The professionals across our
organization - in administration, customer service, mediation, finance, HR, IT, and
adjudication - are the primary reason for our success.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="sjto-3">Legislative Authority: SJTO</h3>
<p>Social Justice Tribunals Ontario (SJTO) is established under the authority of the
<em>Adjudicative Tribunals Accountability, Governance and Appointments Act, 2009</em>
(ATAGAA). The creation of SJTO is part of the government's ongoing efforts to
ensure adjudicative tribunals' best serve the public by being accountable,
transparent and efficient in their operations, and independent in their decision
making functions.
Section 15 of the ATAGAA states that the government may designate a cluster
when <em>"the matters that the tribunals deal with are such that they can operate more
effectively and efficiently as part of a cluster than alone."</em></p>

<h3 id="sjto-4">Operational Highlights: SJTO</h3>
<p>2013-2014 was the second year of SJTO's three-year operational plan. This year,
the senior leadership team reviewed and updated the plan to ensure that SJTO
remains on track to deliver high-quality dispute resolution to Ontarians.</p>
<p>The plan identifies four strategic priorities to guide SJTO's work: dispute resolution,
external service delivery, tribunal modernization and internal transformation.</p>

<h4>Dispute Resolution</h4>
<p><em>Cross-appointments:</em> One of the benefits of clustering is the ability to cross-appoint
members to more than one of the cluster's tribunals. While each tribunal deals with
cases under specific legislation, there are overlaps in the subject areas, the nature
of the disputes and the parties who appear before SJTO tribunals. Cross
appointments enhance members' skills and knowledge which builds adjudicative
capacity and expertise across the cluster. They also give the tribunals more
flexibility in scheduling hearings, making dispute resolution more timely and
accessible. The SJTO now has 20 cross-appointed members.</p>
<p>While there are many benefits to cross-appointments, ensuring and enhancing
expertise remain priorities. Thus all cross appointed members are required to meet
the competencies set for each tribunal to which they are appointed.</p>
<p><em>Recruitment:</em> The process for recruitment of adjudicators under ATAGAA, supports
SJTO's ability to attract individuals with superior knowledge, skills and expertise.
Each vacancy is filled through an open, competitive, merit-based process, in which
candidates are screened and interviewed by an SJTO panel, after which
candidates are recommended to the Attorney General.</p>
<p><em>Mediation and dispute resolution:</em> SJTO has also been building the capacity of
mediation and early dispute resolution programs, in part by training members and
staff mediators through SJTO's annual Professional Development Institute and
other professional development components.</p>
<p><em>Professional development:</em> SJTO held its third annual Professional Development
Institute event, bringing together all members, staff mediators and senior
managers for intensive education and training on topics such as decision writing,
mediation, evidentiary issues, communication in the hearing room, and
accommodating participants who have mental health challenges.</p>
<p><em>Common Rules of Procedure:</em> Developed after extensive stakeholder consultation,
SJTO's Common Rules of Procedure took effect on October 1, 2013. The
Common Rules apply to all SJTO tribunals and provide a consistent framework in
areas such as timeliness and accessibility, as well as providing authority to appoint
litigation guardians and control abuse of process.</p>

<h4>External Service Delivery</h4>
<p><em>Hearing rooms:</em> To improve service delivery and reduce costs, tribunals shared
hearing space and used video technology during more mediations and hearings.
Performance standards: Service excellence is a priority for SJTO. For the second
year, SJTO measured its performance against service standards and published the
results on the SJTO website.</p>
<p>Overall, the numbers are fairly positive and we are moving in the right direction.
SJTO is serious about meeting these standards and if they are not being met, we
examine why. Action plans to help meet these standards include increasing the
number of hearings, the use of early resolution sessions and streamlining business
processes. These initiatives are helping us achieve our targets.</p>
<p><em>French language services:</em> SJTO's new policy on French language services
establishes a consistent standard for tribunals across the cluster so that clients
seeking services in French know what they can expect to receive. The policy will
be implemented in summer 2014.</p>
<p><em>Web communications:</em> SJTO is creating a new website. The new site will replace
the individual tribunal sites, giving the public access to all SJTO and tribunal
information and services in one location. The site is expected to launch in winter
2015.</p>
<p><em>Consultations:</em> SJTO consults with stakeholders and the public on process,
procedure, service and accessibility. When new or amended rules or policies are
proposed, SJTO has committed to posting the revisions on the SJTO website for a
minimum of two weeks.</p>

<h4>Tribunal Modernization</h4>
<p><em>Evaluation:</em> SJTO began developing an evaluation framework. The framework will
help us assess our performance and develop evidence-based plans to address
gaps and respond to the evolving needs of the communities we serve.</p>

<h4>Internal Transformation</h4>
<p><em>Management structure:</em> SJTO introduced a new management structure to support
more effective and efficient business processes. A Director of Operations position
was established to ensure a coordinated approach to operations across the
cluster. To support the Director of Operations, three Registrar positions have been
put in place. These positions are responsible for overseeing case management as
well as day-to-day operations at the SJTO tribunals.</p>
<p><em>Co-location:</em> SJTO continues to work on co-locating a number of its Toronto
offices. Co-location will lead to increased accessibility, capacity and expertise for
the cluster. The project plan has SJTO co-locating most Toronto offices in early
2016.</p>
<p><em>Virtual staff meetings:</em> SJTO began holding regular staff meetings via video
conference. The meetings support the alignment of the cluster's tribunals by
keeping staff across the province up-to-date on changes happening across SJTO.
Holding the meetings virtually offers flexibility in staff scheduling, ensuring services
to the public are not disrupted.</p>

<h4>Tribunal Initiatives</h4>
<p>In addition to these corporate (cluster-level) activities, each of the tribunals led
initiatives that support the strategic priorities. These projects are highlighted in the
sections of the report for each tribunal.</p>

<h3 id="sjto-5">Accessibility and Diversity at SJTO</h3>
<p>Access to justice, diversity and inclusion are core values of SJTO. We are
committed to an inclusive work environment that reflects Ontario's diversity and to
designing barrier-free policies, processes and services.</p>

<h4>Accessibility</h4>
<p>In 2013-14, SJTO developed a cross cluster <em>Accessibility and Accommodation
Policy</em> that outlines our commitment to treating all people with dignity and respect
and supports their independence. The policy is accompanied by a <em>Multi-Year
Accessibility and Accommodation Plan</em> which is focused on identifying and
removing barriers so that all members of the public have equitable access to our
services.</p>
<p>In 2013-14, SJTO improved access in the following ways:</p>
<li>Established common rules for our tribunals to achieve more consistent access</li>
<li>Developed and published a plain language "Guide to Mediation at the HRTO"</li>
<li>Implemented digital recording of Social Benefits Tribunal hearings. Recordings have been requested by persons with cognitive and/or mental health issues to help recall what happened during the hearing.</li>
<li>Used more telephone and video conferencing at the Social Benefits Tribunal. These hearing formats meant that parties who have a disability that makes travel difficult or who live far from the hearing site, did not have to travel.</li>
<li>Trained staff on the Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation and the Ontario <em>Human Rights Code</em> related obligations</li>
<li>Established an Accommodation Coordinators Working Group to provide an opportunity for our tribunals to share best practices and develop in-house training programs</li>
<li>Participated in a consultation session with persons with disabilities and the organizations that represent them to help SJTO establish its own practices.</li>

<h4>Diversity</h4>
<p>The Multi-Year Accessibility and Accommodation Plan is linked to the Multi-Year
Diversity Plan which has commitments in four categories: people, processes,
services and results.</p>
<p>These are some of the SJTO initiatives that supported diversity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Established a committee that supported diversity, inclusion and accessibility in the organization.</li>
<li>Posted a statement of commitment to diversity and inclusion, and the three-year diversity plan, on SJTO's public website</li>
<li>Sponsored "Day of Pink" activities across the cluster to raise awareness of the negative impacts of bullying</li>
<li>Hosted "Positive Space" training for interested employees in Toronto, and</li>
<li>Conducted a staff/member survey on diversity and inclusion to identify areas of focus for the plan.</li>
</ul>

<p>Commitments to accessibility and inclusion are also found in SJTO's <a href="/en/mandate-mission-values/">mission and core values</a>, our Code of Conduct</a> and our business plan.</p>

<li>A particular placement where a young person is being held or to which the young person has been transferred</li>
<li>A provincial director's refusal to authorize the young person's temporary release or reintegration leave</li>
<li>The young person's transfer from a place of open custody to a place of secure custody</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cfsrb-crb-2">Operational Highlights: CFRSB / CRB</h3>
<p>CFRSB / CRB activities focused on changes under the strategic priority areas of
tribunal modernization, dispute resolution, and external service delivery.
The format of pre-hearing conferences was made more consistent, which has
resulted in more effective hearings. CFSRB / CRB also invested in adjudicator
training, implemented new, more efficient processes, and promoted continuous
collaboration with stakeholders such as the Office of the Children's Lawyer and the
Office of the Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth.</p>

<h4>Tribunal Modernization</h4>
<p>Amendments to the regulation governing Section 68.1 of the <em>Child and Family
Services Act</em> came into force in September 2013. Section 68 relates to complaints
against children's aid societies. The amendments required changes to the process
and format of pre-hearing conferences and modified the timelines at each step of
the process. Regulation 70 was also amended to reduce the CFSRB panel size,
from three members to one, resulting in increased flexibility in the scheduling of
hearings and reduced costs.</p>

<h4>Dispute Resolution</h4>
<p>CFSRB continued settlement facilitation for Section 68 disputes and introduced
settlement facilitation for Sections 36, 61 and 144 of the <em>Child and Family Services
Act</em>. Settlement facilitation gives parties the opportunity to reach a mutually-agreed
upon outcome instead of proceeding directly to a hearing. In 2013-14, the
settlement rate for Section 68 disputes was 88 per cent.</p>
<p>This year, CFSRB implemented the use of talking circles, a process used by First
Nations to resolve some disputes. CFSRB has started a review of its adjudicative
process to include talking circles for applications when one party is First Nations
and all parties consent.</p>

<h4>External Service Delivery</h4>
<p>CFSRB / CRB works with the Offices of the Children's Lawyer and of the Provincial
Advocate for Children and Youth to ensure that children and youth have legal
representation in cases before them. The Office of the Children's Lawyer continues
to provide representatives in Section 61, 144 and 36 applications, and the Office of
the Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth offers information about the
CFSRB / CRB to children and their families.</p>

<h2 id="hrto">HUMAN RIGHTS TRIBUNAL OF ONTARIO</h2>

<h3 id="hrto-1">Legislative Authority: HRTO</h3>
<p>The Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario (HRTO) is established under the Ontario
<em>Human Rights Code</em>. Since June 2008, all claims of discrimination under the <em>Code</em>
have been dealt with through applications filed with the HRTO. The HRTO's
primary role is to provide an expeditious and accessible process for resolving
those applications through voluntary mediation or, where the dispute is not
resolved through mediation, a hearing and an enforceable decision.</p>

<h3 id="hrto-2">Operational Highlights: HRTO</h3>
<p>HRTO focused on tribunal modernization and external service delivery. The
tribunal continued to reduce its active caseload. HRTO is also working closely with
stakeholders to address recommendations of the Pinto Report.</p>

<h4>Tribunal Modernization</h4>
<p>The "Pinto Report" reviewing Ontario's human rights system reforms was released
in November 2012. Although the report was generally positive about the new
system, it contained a number of recommendations specific to the HRTO. In
response to the recommendations, the HRTO has changed processes, modified
forms and, in April 2014, will be introducing new practice directions for parties.
Practice directions give practical advice on how to interpret tribunal rules. Work to
revise the application and response forms to reduce duplication and length and
increase accessibility continues. The HRTO also posted more accessible Word
versions of the application forms to its website.</p>

<h4>External Service Delivery</h4>
<p>HRTO is working with the Human Rights Commission and the Human Rights Legal
Support Centre to further improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the human
rights system in Ontario.</p>

<h4>Caseload</h4>
<p>The HRTO reduced its caseload in 2013-2014. There were 3,061 open
applications at the start of the fiscal year. By year-end, that number had been
reduced by 67 cases to 2,994 (with 421 of these remaining cases deferred pending
the outcome of some other proceeding outside the HRTO). This was accomplished
in spite of an increase of 405 applications over last fiscal year.</p>

<p>The HRTO also issued 1,794 Case Assessment Directions dealing with various

<h4>Transitional Applications and Commission Referred Complaints</h4>
<p>June 2008 amendments to the <em>Code</em> established the new human rights system and
included a mechanism for dealing with complaints still pending at the Ontario
Human Rights Commission. For a period of one year, the complainant could bring
the complaint to the HRTO by filing an application under section 53 of the <em>Code</em>.
The HRTO received almost 2,000 such applications. As well, the Commission
continued to refer complaints to the HRTO until December 31, 2008.</p>
<p>Most of the Transition Applications and Commission Referred Complaints have
been resolved. At the end of fiscal 2013-2014, the open caseload was:</p>

<p><strong>Transitional Applications</strong>
<br>16 open cases:</p>
<ul>
	<li>2 were pending final decision</li>
	<li>12 were deferred pending the outcome of some other process</li>
	<li>1 was at the hearing stage</li>
	<li>1 was combined with s.34 applications</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Commission Referred Complaints</strong>
<br>2 open cases:</p>

<h2 id="ltb">LANDLORD AND TENANT BOARD</h2>

<h3 id="ltb-1">Legislative Authority: LTB</h3>
<p>The Landlord and Tenant Board (LTB) is established under the <em>Residential
Tenancies Act (RTA)</em> to hear and decide applications relating to residential
tenancies. Mediation of disputes is provided with the consent of the parties.</p>
<p>The LTB also provides information to landlords and tenants about their rights and
obligations under the RTA.</p>

<h4>Resolving disputes</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Adjudication</strong>
	<p>Subsection 168(2) of the RTA provides that the LTB has exclusive jurisdiction to
	determine all applications under the act, while section 174 provides the LTB with
	the authority to hear and determine all questions of law and fact with respect to all
	matters within its jurisdiction.</p>
	<p>Pursuant to section 183 of the RTA, the LTB strives to provide the most
	expeditious method of determining the questions that arise in a proceeding and to
	provide parties an adequate opportunity to know the issues and to be heard on the
	matter.</p>
	<p>Hearings are held at the LTB's eight offices as well as at a number of other
	locations across the province.</p></li>
	<li><strong>Mediation</strong>
	<p>Section 194 of the RTA allows the LTB to mediate disputes, if both parties agree.
	LTB mediators are available to meet with parties to try to help them reach an
	agreement.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Providing Information</h4>
<p>Section 177 of the RTA requires the LTB to give information to landlords and
tenants about their rights and obligations. The LTB fulfills this mandate by
providing counter-service in its offices across the province, and through a website
and a call centre. LTB handled 293,351 telephone calls in 2013-2014.</p>

<h3 id="ltb-2">Operational Highlights: LTB</h3>
<p>The LTB developed and implemented several initiatives to support the provision of
fair, effective, timely and accessible dispute resolution for the residential housing
sector in Ontario. LTB initiatives focused on the areas of tribunal modernization,
dispute resolution and external service delivery.</p>

<h4>Tribunal Modernization</h4>
<p>LTB is expecting the proclamation of Bill 140 in 2014/15. With a few exceptions,
the bill requires LTB to serve the Notice of Hearing package on the parties.
Although the bill is not yet law, the LTB is preparing by updating its rules and
procedures and application forms.</p>

<h4>Dispute Resolution</h4>
<p>Bill 14, which was passed by the Legislature on September 26, 2013, provides for
most co-op eviction disputes to be dealt with by the LTB. Bill 14 also introduced
"fee waivers" which permit the LTB to waive or defer fees for low-income
individuals. In anticipation of the bill being proclaimed in spring 2014, the LTB is
developing new rules, practice directions, forms and procedures.</p>
<p>The LTB has continued to deal with most landlord applications for non-payment of
rent (L1s and L9s) on specific days at each office. As a result, time to hearing has
decreased and application scheduling has become more predictable.</p>

<h4>External Service Delivery</h4>
<p>LTB is developing an electronic filing system that will provide clients with a new,
secure and simple online filing solution. It will allow clients to file applications more
quickly, at any time and from anywhere. Implementation is anticipated for early
2015.</p>
<p>The LTB renewed its focus on stakeholder engagement and finalized the terms of
reference for the newly-formed Practice Advisory Committee (PAC) which includes
representatives from the Advocacy Centre for Tenants Ontario, the Federation of
Rental Housing Providers of Ontario, the Ontario Non-Profit Housing Association,
and the Co-operative Housing Federation. The PAC will allow stakeholders to chair
and direct the discussion.</p>

<h3 id="ltb-3">Service Standards: LTB</h3>
<div class="box">
<p><strong>All applications, except those dealing with an above guideline increase
(AGIs) and an application to vary the amount of the reduction (A4s), will have

<br><em>Result: 88%</em></p>
</div>
<p><strong>*Note:</strong> LTB's case management system reports in business days.</p>

<h3 id="ltb-4">Statistics/ Commentary: LTB</h3>
<p>In 2013-14, the LTB received 81,748 applications. This is a decrease of 443
applications compared to 2012-2013.</p>
<p>The ratio of landlord to tenant applications has remained relatively constant since
1998 when the resolution of landlord-tenant disputes was transferred from the
provincial court system to the LTB. This past year was no exception, with 91 per
cent of applications filed by landlords and nine per cent filed by tenants.</p>
<p>Applications for termination of tenancy and eviction continue to represent the bulk
of the LTB's workload. Of the total applications received by the LTB, 64.6 per cent
were for termination of tenancy because of arrears of rent.</p>

<h4>Application Resolution</h4>
<p>For the fiscal year 2013-2014, the LTB received 81,748 applications and resolved
82,126 applications. Some applications may generate more than one resolution
because of the re-opening and review processes. As of March 31, 2014 the
number of unresolved RTA applications was 8,497.</p>

<h4>Mediation</h4>
<p>The LTB employs mediators throughout the province to provide mediation services
where both parties involved in an application are interested in working together to
resolve the issues in dispute. In the 2013-2014 fiscal year, approximately 36 per
cent of all applications where both parties attended the hearing were successfully
resolved through mediated agreements and/or consent orders* arrived at during
mediation.</p>
<p>*Like a mediated agreement, both parties agree to the terms of consent orders.
Unlike mediated agreements, however, the terms of a consent order are limited to
the scope of the application and they are enforceable in the same way as any
other LTB order for eviction or money owed.</p>

<h4>Review and Appeal Statistics</h4>
<p>A party to an application may ask for a review of an LTB order if he or she believes
that the order contains a serious error or that a serious error occurred in the
proceedings. This includes circumstances where a party was not reasonably able
to participate in the proceeding.</p>
<p>In 2013-2014, the LTB received 2,376 requests for review, three per cent of the
total number of applications received. Of the review requests received, 881 were
sent to hearing.</p>

<h2 id="oset">ONTARIO SPECIAL EDUCATION TRIBUNALS</h2>

<h3 id="oset-1">Legislative Authority: OSETs</h3>
<p>The legislative mandate of the Ontario Special Education Tribunals (OSETs) is
found in section 57 of the <em>Education Act</em>. Their primary role is to adjudicate appeals
initiated by parents regarding identification and/or placement decisions made by
school boards with respect to students with special needs (exceptional pupils), and
to make decisions that are in the best interest of these pupils.</p>
<p>The Ontario Special Education (English) Tribunal hears appeals for students
enrolled in the English-language school boards, both public and Roman Catholic.
Le Tribunal de l'enfance en difficulté de l'Ontario (français) hears appeals for
students enrolled in French-language school boards, both public and Roman
Catholic.</p>
<p>The OSETs are appeal tribunals. OSET appellants must first have satisfied the
prerequisites set out in the <em>Education Act</em> and its regulations, before they are
legally entitled to appeal.</p>

<h2 id="oset">SOCIAL BENEFITS TRIBUNAL</h2>

<h3 id="sbt-1">Legislative Authority: SBT</h3>
<p>The Social Benefits Tribunal (SBT) was established in 1998 under Part IV of the
<em>Ontario Works Act</em>, 1997. Appeals are heard under that act and the <em>Ontario
Disability Support Program Act</em>, 1997. The SBT considers appeals by individuals
who have been refused social assistance and recipients of social assistance who
disagree with a decision that affects the amount of, or their eligibility for, social
assistance.</p>
<p>The SBT conducts hearings throughout Ontario. Because of the sensitive personal
information involved in these cases, the legislation requires that all hearings must
be held in private.</p>

<h3 id="sbt-2">Operational Highlights: SBT</h3>
<p>SBT focused in the areas of tribunal modernization, dispute resolution and external
service delivery. The SBT enhanced the Interim Assistance process and prioritized
the use of the Early Resolution Program while maintaining strong relationships with
stakeholders through the establishment of several new working groups.</p>

<h4>Tribunal Modernization</h4>
<p>Digital recording of hearings was implemented across SBT in early 2014. These
recordings give all parties access to an accurate record of the hearing.</p>

<h4>Dispute Resolution</h4>
<p>SBT continues to review and improve the Early Resolution Program (ERP) which is
an important tool in achieving efficient and effective dispute resolution. The ERP is
held via telephone and includes the two parties and a SBT staff member, who
seeks ways to resolve the appeal without a full hearing. Criteria have been
developed to ensure that appropriate cases are selected for ERP. This year, SBT
scheduled over 1,525 ERP sessions, an increase of 41% from the previous year.
This year's settlement rate was 30%, an improvement from the previous year's
21%.</p>

<h4>External Service Delivery</h4>
<p>Interim assistance may be available to those who are experiencing financial
hardship while waiting for a hearing before the SBT. A team produced revised
guidelines which were introduced in November 2013 and are proving to be a
valuable resource for staff. The new guidelines establish a more consistent
process and allow staff to process requests more quickly.</p>
<p>Building on its ongoing communication with stakeholders, a new working group
with membership from SBT, Ministry of Community and Social Services and legal
aid clinics was formed to make recommendations to the Practice Advisory
Committee (PAC). The working group is also developing a new case streaming
strategy that would identify problems with appeals early in the process, notify the
applicants of the problems and, where possible, resolve the appeal prior to
scheduling a hearing.</p>

<h3 id="sbt-3">Service Standards: SBT</h3>
<div class="box">
<p><strong>Appeals will be scheduled with a notice of hearing sent out no later than 30

<h3 id="sbt-4">Statistics/Commentary: SBT</h3>
<p>The SBT completed 14,225 appeals in 2013-14, an increase of 900 from the
previous year but due to a substantial number of incoming appeals the number of
outstanding appeals still increased by more than 500 cases. The overall average
case processing time increased slightly from 8.7 months to 8.9 months.</p>
