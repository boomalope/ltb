<div class="box"><strong>Michael Gottheil, Executive Chair</strong>
<br><em>Social Justice Tribunals Ontario</em></div>
<br>

<p>I am very pleased to present the 2012-2013 Annual Report of the Social Justice
Tribunals Ontario (SJTO).</p>
<p>In last year's report, I wrote about the concept of clustering. Specifically, how a
tribunal cluster can improve access and the quality of justice by leveraging the
strength of a larger organization, creating momentum for constructive change, and
providing opportunities to gain efficiencies which can be re-invested into enhanced
service delivery. While it is easy to articulate the opportunities clustering creates,
transforming the organization to capitalize on these opportunities is a much more
significant undertaking. I believe that over the past year we have made real
strides. I would like to highlight a few.</p>
<p>SJTO has begun to mature as a justice organization. Staff and members alike
have coalesced around our Mission and Core Values, and have worked together,
on a variety of planes, to provide professional, high-quality dispute resolution to
Ontarians. Within each tribunal and across the tribunals, SJTO members and staff
are working to "raise the bar", develop innovative ways to enhance access to
justice, and achieve one of the key elements of our Mission â€“ to be leaders in the
administrative justice sector.</p>
<p>Over the past year we identified four strategic priorities to guide our work: dispute
resolution, external service delivery, internal transformation, and tribunal
modernization. We also identified a number of projects within each area and
mapped out an operational plan. Reflecting back over the last year, I am proud to
say we have completed some projects, are well underway on a number of others,
and well positioned to continue our exciting work.</p>

<h4>Enhancing the Quality of Dispute Resolution</h4>
<p>As part of our commitment to improve the quality and consistency of dispute
resolution across the cluster, this past year we focused on a comprehensive
member recruitment and cross-appointment strategy. Using the position
descriptions we developed last year, and identifying needed skills, background and
expertise within our tribunals, when vacancies came up, we were able to recruit
and recommend highly qualified candidates. The open and competitive
recruitment process also meant we had a better pool of candidates applying to
become tribunal members.</p>
<p>We also provided a number of opportunities for cross-appointments. Here the
focus was on leveraging the breadth and depth of knowledge that currently exists 
across the SJTO and filling particular gaps, supporting professional development,
and providing career development opportunities. Where we identified the need for
cross appointments, we ensured that members who are cross appointed have the
requisite skills and qualifications. Cross appointments also assisted in improving
our geographic coverage and French-language service delivery.</p>
<p>In 2012-13 we continued to work on our professional development strategy. We
developed tribunal specific, new member training modules, which include common
core competencies. We began work on online and in person courses on human
rights, evidence, decision writing and other skill areas. And we planned and
delivered our annual Professional Development Institute, which brought together
all our members for intense, peer supported training and education.</p>
<p>Finally, in an effort to bring a more coherent and understandable face of justice to
the public, we embarked on a project to develop common rules. While specific
tribunal procedures will require specific rules, common terminology and approach
will help the public better understand and access the services we provide. Early in
2013 we launched a consultation on an initial set of common rules, which include
rules governing basic adjudicative values, and the ability of parties to designate a
litigation guardian. In the coming months we will develop and circulate additional
rules.</p>

<h4>External Service Delivery</h4>
<p>With a focus on enhancing service delivery we have been successful over the past
year in increasing the use of virtual hearings to permit people in remote areas
greater and more timely access to justice in a more effective and efficient manner.
Also, we are piloting a range of mediation models and boosting access to
mediation at several tribunals within the cluster. In order to enhance transparency
and access to information, we are now posting decisions of the Social Benefits
Tribunal on publically accessible websites. Similarly, we have a project underway
to increase access to Landlord and Tenant Board decisions.</p>
<p>To help us measure our work we developed a number of service standards. We
will soon be providing results to the public on an annual basis that report on how
well we are doing in meeting these standards. Overall, the numbers are fairly
positive but they have also identified areas where we need to improve and we will
put in place plans to close any gaps in service that may be identified.</p>
<p>Switching from an internal to an external lens, in November 2012 the "Pinto
Report" on the review of Ontario's human rights system reforms was released. Mr.
Pinto was generally positive about the new system which he found to be more
effective, expeditious and accessible. He gave the Human Rights Tribunal of
Ontario (HRTO) high marks in a number of areas. At the same time, the report
contains a number of recommendations specific to the HRTO and we are currently
working on initiatives to respond to many of these recommendations.</p>

<h4>A Year of Change</h4>
<p>The past year also saw a number of changes in the leadership of the cluster. With
regrets, we said goodbye to C&eacute;line Allard, Associate Chair of the Ontario Special
Education (French) Tribunal and to Gary Yee, Associate Chair of the Social
Benefits Tribunal. I am grateful to David Wright for agreeing to take on the ViceChair
role at both of the Special Education Tribunals and to Beverly Moore for
agreeing to act as the interim Associate Chair of the Social Benefits Tribunal.
Along with Suzanne Gilbert and Lilian Ma, I am fortunate to have such dedicated
and capable colleagues, leading and transforming, our constituent tribunals. We
also welcomed Ellen Wexler as the new Executive Lead of SJTO and her wealth of
experience has been instrumental in driving the internal transformation and tribunal
modernization priorities.</p>
<p>We've travelled a long way in the two years since the cluster was first announced
and while there is more to be done, we embrace the work and the challenges that
lie ahead. A wealth of experience exists within the SJTO tribunals and my thanks
go out to all of the adjudicative members and the staff of SJTO for their hard work
and dedication. The real strength of our justice organization rests with them.</p>

<h3 id="sjto-2">Executive Lead's Message</h3>
<div class="box"><strong>Ellen Wexler, Executive Lead</strong>
<br><em>Social Justice Tribunals Ontario</em></div>
<br>

<p>Bringing together seven adjudicative tribunals into a single organization presents
many opportunities to improve effectiveness and efficiency, but it also has its share
of challenges. It requires a long term strategic vision to guide the many short term
operational decisions required to ensure a successful transition. This was my first
year at SJTO and I have been very impressed by the dedication and commitment
from the members, staff and stakeholders. I took the opportunity to visit all of the
offices across the province and to meet with many of the stakeholders.</p>
<p>SJTO is undertaking strategic internal reforms to ensure our organization is
structured and our business processes are aligned to support the vision of
transformation leading to an effective and efficient organizational structure that
meets the highest standards of professionalism, integrity and quality of work.</p>
<p>Last year, as an interim step in our longer term goal to collocate a number of our
Toronto locations, the Child and Family Service Review Board/Custody Review
Board moved locations to share accommodations and hearing rooms with the
Social Benefits Tribunal. Provisions were made to ensure that service to the
parties appearing before the boards were not impacted by the move. This move
allows the tribunals to work more closely together, share resources and develop a
collaborative environment.</p>
<p>As part of tribunal modernization, the Landlord and Tenant Board is in the initial
phases of working on an e-filing option that will offer secure and simple filing and
will allow individuals to file applications online quickly, at any time and from
anywhere. The e-filing system will help ensure accurate filings by including
prompts, such as explaining fields and noting missed information, to guide the user
in filling out the form.</p>
<p>One of SJTO's core values is a commitment to access to justice, diversity and
inclusion, and as part of its efforts in this area, we have formed a Diversity,
Inclusion and Accessibility Committee to develop a multi-year approach to
implement the diversity, inclusion and accessibility commitments of SJTO. The
plan is intended to help SJTO create respectful and inclusive work environments
and embed diversity and inclusion practices and principles into its policies,
processes and services. It will ensure that SJTO continues to:</p>
<ul>
<li>deliver inclusive, accessible and responsive services to the public;</li>
<li>build a respectful and inclusive organizational culture and healthy workplace; and</li>
<li>meet accessibility requirements under the <em>Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act</em> and Ontario's accessibility laws.</li>
</ul>

<p>SJTO tribunals also provide services to the public in both official languages in
accordance with the <em>French Language Services Act</em> (FLSA). Regional offices in
areas designated by the FLSA have bilingual staff available. We are also
developing a FLSA plan that will assist us in providing consistent and improved
French language services.</p>
<p>SJTO has been working on a plan for the next phase of its transformation. We are
one step closer to our goal of an integrated organization with a plan, as mentioned
earlier, to co-locate some of the Toronto offices as well as a new management
structure.</p>
<p>I would like to extend a special thank you to all of the staff at SJTO and to let you
know how proud I am of the great work they do year round. SJTO couldn't carry
out its day-to-day activities and make the strides it does without everyone's help.</p>

<h3 id="sjto-3">Legislative Authority</h3>
<p>Social Justice Tribunals Ontario (SJTO) is established under the authority of the
<em>Adjudicative Tribunals Accountability, Governance and Appointments Act, 2009</em>
(the Tribunals Act.) The creation of SJTO is part of the government's ongoing
efforts to ensure adjudicative tribunals best serve the public by being accountable,
transparent and efficient in their operations, and independent in their decision
making functions.</p>
<p>Section 15 of the Tribunals Act states that the government may designate a cluster
when <em>"the matters that the tribunals deal with are such that they can operate more
effectively and efficiently as part of a cluster than alone."</em></p>

<h2 id="cfsrb-crb">CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES REVIEW BOARD/CUSTODY REVIEW BOARD</h2>

<h3 id="cfsrb-crb-1">Associate Chair's Message</h3>
<div class="box"><strong>Suzanne Gilbert, Associate Chair</strong>
<br><em>Child and Family Services Review Board/Custody Review Board</em></div>
<br>

<p>It is with great pleasure that I share with you the highlights for the fiscal year 2012-
2013 for the Child and Family Services Review Board (CFSRB) and Custody
Review Board (CRB).</p>
<p>There were a number of interesting decisions this year on the subject matter of
contempt in <em>J.C. v. Durham Children's Aid Society, 2012 CFSRB 26</em>, the
jurisdiction of the Board in <em>V.T. and D.T. v. Children's Aid Society of London and
Middlesex, 2012 CFSRB 50</em> and rescinding the refusal of an adoption application
in <em>J.P. and M.P. v. Children's Aid Society of Algoma (CFSA s.144), 2013 CFSRB 5</em>.</p>
<p>The quality of adjudication remained our main focus throughout the year. Some
changes were made to the decision review process and to the framework of
decision writing. We began an initiative for streamlining the hearing process for
the service related complaint applications involving children's aid societies. These
changes will be in line with the SJTO's values of active adjudication and
proportionality. Some work will follow to adapt processes and Rules during the
next fiscal year in light of pending regulation changes.</p>
<p>The settlement facilitation program has been very useful to the parties involved in
complaints regarding services provided by children's aid societies. Settlement
agreements were reached in 75 per cent of the files scheduled for settlement
facilitation. The Board has also expanded the use of mediation.</p>
<p>A meeting was held this year with stakeholders involved in the emergency secure
admission treatment of children. This first meeting was an opportunity to exchange
ideas and open the doors to a shared dialogue aimed at ensuring fair and timely
access to justice.</p>
<p>The coming year will bring many challenges. I am confident that staff and
members will continue to support our work with their unwavering dedication and
professionalism and I thank them for their collaboration and commitment to their
work.</p>

<h3 id="cfsrb-crb-2">Legislative Authority</h3>
<h4>The Child and Family Services Review Board (CFSRB)</h4>
<p>Under the <em>Child and Family Services Act (CFSA)</em>, the CFSRB is mandated to review:</p>

<li>A decision of a children's aid society to refuse an application to adopt a particular child, or a decision of a society or licensee to remove a child from an adoption placement, pursuant to section 144.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the <em>Education Act</em>, the Board hears appeals of:</p>
<ul>
<li>School board expulsion decisions pursuant to section 311.7.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the <em>Intercountry Adoption Act</em>, the Board reviews:</p>

<li>A director's refusal to approve a proposed intercountry adoption, or the
attachment of conditions to a director's approval, pursuant to section 6.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Custody Review Board (CRB)</h4>
<p>Under section 97(1) of the <em>Child and Family Services Act</em>, the CRB hears applications and makes recommendations to provincial directors who make decisions with respect to youth in custody regarding:</p>
<ul>

<li>A provincial director's refusal to authorize the young person's temporary release or reintegration leave</li>
<li>The young person's transfer from a place of open custody to a place of secure custody</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cfsrb-crb-3">Operational Highlights</h3>
<p>The Board* was actively involved again this year in the transformation agenda of
the SJTO. The Board's office moved locations to share accommodations and
hearing rooms with the Social Benefits Tribunal. The transition took a few months
but staff, members and operations settled in by the end of the fiscal year.
Provisions were made to ensure that service to parties appearing before the Board
was not impacted by the move.</p>

<h3 id="cfsrb-crb-4">Statistics/Commentary</h3>
<p>In the 2012-2013 fiscal year, the CFSRB received 300 applications: the same as
last fiscal year and the CRB received 144 applications for a total of 444
applications. There is a slight decrease from the previous year as a result of fewer
CRB applications. The following chart provides a summary of the caseloads for
the last three fiscal years:</p>

<h2 id="hrto">HUMAN RIGHTS TRIBUNAL OF ONTARIO</h2>

<h3 id="hrto-1">Associate Chair's Message</h3>
<div class="box"><strong>David A. Wright, Associate Chair</strong>
<br><em>Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario</em></div>
<br>

<p>I am pleased to present the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario (HRTO) section of
the SJTO annual report. This has been a significant year, with improvements in the
management of our caseload and important jurisprudential developments.</p>
<p>The HRTO continued to establish jurisprudence that provides guidance to
Ontarians on the rights in the Code. Significant decisions this year addressed the
emerging issues of family status in the workplace (<em>Devaney v. ZRV Holdings
Limited</em>, 2012 HRTO 1590), the rights of transgendered persons (<em>XY v. Ontario
Government and Consumer Services</em>), 2012 HRTO 726 and Vanderputten v.
Seydaco Packaging Inc., 2012 HRTO 2165), and competing human rights (<em>Taylor-Baptiste
v. Ontario Public Services Employees Union</em>, 2012 HRTO 1393 and 2013
HRTO 180). We addressed when applications are considered to be filed beyond
the one-year time limit in the <em>Code</em> (Garrie <em>v. Janus Joan Inc.</em>, 2012 HRTO 995
and <em>Ward-Taylor v. Instachange Displays Limited</em>, 2012 HRTO 1282), breaches of
confidentiality provisions in settlements (<em>Tremblay v. 1168531 Ontario Inc.</em>, 2012
HRTO 1939) and interim remedies where elementary school students were not
attending school (<em>R.B. v. Keewatin-Patricia District School Board</em>, 2013 HRTO 130
and <em>T.B. v. Halton District School Board</em>, 2013 HRTO 304).</p>

<p>The summary hearing process established in 2010 continued to be an important
part of the HRTO's work. Summary hearings resulted in the dismissal of many
cases that had no reasonable prospect of success. Even where it was determined
that the matter should go on to a full hearing, the issues were often narrowed,
resulting in more efficient hearings.</p>
<p>We were pleased to welcome three new vice-chairs and eight members this year.
They bring an exceptional level of adjudicative and human rights expertise from a
variety of backgrounds.</p>
<p>I want to thank the members of the public, the human rights community and our
Practice Advisory Committee for their ongoing support and feedback. We continue
to strive for improvement in the dispute resolution we provide, and your
communication assists us greatly.</p>
<p>I want to close by thanking our staff and adjudicators for their hard work throughout
this period, which has meant that we have continued to reduce caseload and
timelines despite the heavy demands of increased hearings. We expect to see the
statistical results of our intensive work even more in the next fiscal year, as
timelines for new cases become shorter.</p>

<h3 id="hrto-2">Legislative Authority</h3>
<p>The HRTO is established under the Ontario Human Rights Code. Since June
2008, all claims of discrimination under the Code are dealt with through
applications filed directly with the HRTO. The HRTO's primary role is to provide an
expeditious and accessible process for resolving those applications through
voluntary mediation or, where the dispute is not resolved through mediation, a
hearing and an enforceable decision.</p>

<h3 id="hrto-3">Operational Highlights</h3>
<p>The highlight of this fiscal year was an ongoing "blitz" of merits hearings. Following
changes to the HRTO's processes in mid-2010, it has reduced its active caseload
by over one quarter since early 2011, first through an intensive focus on mediation,
and then an emphasis on merits hearings while maintaining timely mediations.</p>

<h3 id="hrto-4">Statistics and Commentary</h3>
<h4>Caseload</h4>
<p>The HRTO continued to reduce its active caseload in 2012-2013. There were
3,302 open s.34 cases at the start of the fiscal year. By year-end, that number had
been reduced to 3,061, with 416 of these cases deferred pending the outcome of
some other proceeding outside the HRTO. The number of open cases is now less
than the number of files closed in each of the previous two fiscal years.
The following statistics refer only to "New Applications" made under section 34 of
the <em>Code</em>, not Transitional Applications or Commission Referred Complaints.</p>

<br>

<p>Of the cases closed in fiscal 2012-2013 where the application was accepted, 1,251
(54%) were closed within one year. The average time from application acceptance
to closure was 406 days, with a median of 329 days. However, a large number of
files â€“ 803 â€“ were closed that did not reach the application acceptance stage
because they were resolved on some preliminary basis, including the new
Summary Hearing process. The HRTO currently does not have timeline measures
for these 803 closures, but many of them were resolved within one year.</p>

<p>The HRTO also issued 1,862 Case Assessment Directions dealing with various
procedural issues.</p>

<h4>Transitional Applications and Commission Referred Complaints</h4>
<p>June 2008 amendments to the Code established the new human rights system and
included a mechanism for dealing with complaints still pending at the Ontario
Human Rights Commission. For a period of one year, the complainant could bring
the complaint to the HRTO by filing an application under section 53 of the <em>Code</em>.
The HRTO received almost 2,000 such applications. As well, the Commission
continued to refer complaints to the HRTO until December 31, 2008.</p>
<p>Most all of the Transition Applications and Commission Referred Complaints have
been resolved. At the end of fiscal 2012-2013, the open caseload was:</p>

<h5>Transitional Applications:</h5>
<p>52 open cases, although many are related. Of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>23 were pending final decision (19 involved applications heard together)</li>
<li>16 were deferred pending the outcome of some other process</li>
<li>12 were at the mediation or hearing stage</li>
<li>one was combined with section 34 applications</li>
</ul>

<h5>Commission Referred Complaints:</h5>
<p>Four open cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>one for monitoring</li>
<li>three awaiting decision (includes the many special diet files as one case)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ltb">LANDLORD AND TENANT BOARD</h2>

<h3 id="ltb-1">Associate Chair's Message</h3>
<div class="box"><strong>Lilian Ma, Associate Chair &emsp; Alternate Executive Chair</strong>
<br><em>Landlord and Tenant Board &emsp; Social Justice Tribunals Ontario</em></div>
<br>

<p>Last year, the Landlord and Tenant Board (LTB) made great strides on a number
of initiatives to help us achieve our mission to provide fair, effective, timely and
accessible dispute resolution for the residential rental housing sector in Ontario.</p>
<p>In November 2011, as a result of client feedback, the Board implemented a new
scheduling model for those application types that make up the majority of the
applications submitted. This initiative has proven to be successful in increasing the
predictability of our scheduling and reducing time to hearing for both landlord and
tenant applications.</p>
<p>We appreciate the input of stakeholders who participated in our first online
consultation this past fiscal year about proposed changes to the rules of practice,
L1/L9 hearing day update form and request for consent form. This online
consultation enabled us to reach broader and different audiences offering us the
ability to improve access to justice.</p>
<p>As part of its overall efficiencies exercise, LTB is also streamlining the processing
of the L5 application for above the guideline rent increases and the A4 application
to vary the rent reduction.</p>
<p>E-filing is an exciting initiative for the Landlord and Tenant Board. Although it is in
the initial phases, this system will offer secure and simple filing and will allow
individuals to file applications online quickly, at any time and from anywhere.
I appreciate the ongoing commitment of members and staff in delivering the
Board's important services and to tenants and landlords and for their valuable input
into the Board's initiatives.</p>


<h3 id="ltb-2">Legislative Authority</h3>
<p>The Landlord and Tenant Board (LTB) draws its legislative authority from the
<em>Residential Tenancies Act</em>, 2006 (the RTA or the Act), which sets out, in section 1,
the following purposes for the Board:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide protection for residential tenants from unlawful rent increases and unlawful evictions;</li>
<li>establish a framework for the regulation of residential rent;</li>
<li>balance the rights and responsibilities of residential landlords and tenants and;</li>
<li>provide for the adjudication of disputes and for other processes to informally resolve disputes.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Resolving disputes</h4>
<h5>Adjudication</h5>
<p>Subsection 168(2) of the RTA provides that the Board has exclusive jurisdiction to
determine all applications under the Act, while section 174 provides the Board with
the authority to hear and determine all questions of law and fact with respect to all
matters within its jurisdiction under the Act.</p>
<p>Pursuant to section 183 of the Act, the Board strives to provide the most
expeditious method of determining the questions that arise in a proceeding and to
provide parties an adequate opportunity to know the issues and to be heard on the
matter.</p>
<p>Hearings are held at the LTB's eight regional offices as well as at a number of
other locations across the province.</p>

<h5>Mediation</h5>
<p>Section 194 of the Act allows the Board to mediate disputes, if both parties agree
to try this approach. Board Mediators are available to meet with parties to try to
help them reach a workable agreement that is acceptable to both sides.</p>

<h4>Providing Information</h4>
<p>Section 177 of the RTA requires the LTB to give information to landlords and
tenants about their rights and obligations. The LTB fulfills this mandate by
providing counter-service in its offices across the province, and through a website
and a virtual call centre. LTB received 502,321 telephone calls in 2012-2013.</p>

<h4>Amendments to the RTA</h4>
<p>Effective January 1, 2012, the RTA was amended by Bill 140 as part of the Long
Term Affordable Housing Strategy of the Ministry of Housing.
Bill 140 includes an amendment to the RTA that will require the Board to serve the
notice of hearing and application to the respondent unless the Board, as set out in
its Rules, orders the applicant to do so. A proclamation date for this provision has
yet to be announced. The LTB is preparing to implement the changes required by
this amendment and will consult with its stakeholders.</p>

<h3 id="ltb-3">Operational Highlights</h3>
<h4>Orientation to LTB for cross-appointees and new appointees</h4>
<p>The LTB welcomed a number of cross-appointments from other SJTO tribunals as
well as new LTB members. They were provided with training on the RTA to
prepare them for LTB hearings.</p>

<h4>Stakeholder engagement</h4>
<p>During this fiscal year, the LTB met with the Stakeholder Advisory Committee
(SAC), which consists of representatives from the Advocacy Centre for Tenants
Ontario (ACTO), the Federation of Rental Housing Providers of Ontario (FRPO)
and the Ontario Non-Profit Housing Association (ONPHA). The on-going dialogue
between the Board and stakeholder representatives ensures that the views of both
landlord and tenant groups are given the necessary attention in the development of
procedures, forms, Rules of Practice and Interpretation Guidelines. The SAC
meetings are also an important forum for providing progress updates on LTB
initiatives as well as responding to the concerns from landlord and tenant groups.</p>

<h3>Statistics/ Commentary</h3>
<p>From April 1, 2012 to March 31, 2013, the LTB received 82,192 applications. This
is an increase of 1,108 applications compared to the 2011-2012 caseload. Over
the last three years, there has been an increase of more than six per cent in
applications filed with the Board.</p>
<p>The ratio of landlord to tenant applications has remained relatively constant since
1998 when the resolution of landlord-tenant disputes was transferred from the
provincial court system to an adjudicative tribunal. This past year was no
exception, with 91 per cent of applications filed by landlords and nine per cent filed
by tenants.</p>
<p>Applications for termination of tenancy and eviction continue to represent the bulk
of the LTB's workload. Of the total applications received by the LTB, 66.65 per cent
were for termination of tenancy because of arrears of rent.</p>

<h4>Landlord Applications</h4>
<p>The following table shows the number of each application type filed by landlords
for the 2012-2013 fiscal year and the two previous years. The number in brackets
shows the percentage of the total applications filed by landlords.</p>

<h4>Application Resolution</h4>
<p>For the fiscal year 2012-2013, the LTB received 82,192 applications and resolved
80,261 applications. Some applications may generate more than one resolution
because of the re-opening and review processes. As of March 31, 2012 the
number of unresolved RTA applications is 9,580.</p>
<p>The following table shows the total number of applications received, resolved and
outstanding at the end of the fiscal year, for 2012-2013 and the two previous years.</p>

<p>*For fiscal 2012-2013 the LTB statistics are those reported by its case
management system. For previous years, the LTB calculated these statistics
manually.</p>

<p>The following chart shows how applications and resolution are relatively constant
across regions and also illustrates the regional distribution of applications filed with
the board.</p>
<p><font color="red">[ INSERT IMAGE HERE ]</font></p>

<h4>Review and Appeal Statistics</h4>
<p>A party to an application may ask for a review of a Board order if he or she
believes that the order contains a serious error or that a serious error occurred in
the proceedings, including where a party was not reasonably able to participate in
the proceeding.</p>
<p>Over the 2012-2013 fiscal year the LTB received 2,162 requests for review, 2.6 per
cent of the total number of applications received. Of the review requests received,
1,337 (1.6 per cent) were sent to hearing.</p>
<p>Section 210 of the RTA also provides that any person affected by a LTB order may
appeal the order to the Divisional Court within 30 days after being given the order,
but only on a question of law. Over the 2012-2013 fiscal year the LTB received 151
Notices of Appeal of Board orders. This number represents 0.2 per cent of the total
number of applications resolved by the LTB.</p>

<h4>Mediation</h4>

The Landlord and Tenant Board employs mediators throughout the province to
provide mediation services where both parties involved in an application are
interested in working together to resolve the issues in dispute. In the 2012-2013
fiscal year approximately 37 per cent of all applications where both parties
attended the hearing were successfully resolved through mediated agreements
and/or resulted in consent orders.

<h2 id="oset">ONTARIO SPECIAL EDUCATION TRIBUNALS</h2>

<h3 id="oset-1">Vice-Chair's Message</h3>
<div class="box"><strong>David A. Wright, Vice-Chair</strong>
<br><em>Ontario Special Education (English) and (French) Tribunals</em></div>
<br>

<p>I am pleased to present the OSET (English and French) section of the SJTO
annual report.</p>
<p>This has been a year of significant change at the OSETs. The operations of both
special education tribunals were brought within the administrative structure of the
Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario (HRTO). The Registrar of the HRTO, is now
OSET Secretary. In addition to my responsibilities as Associate Chair of HRTO, I
have now been appointed Vice-Chair and lead of the OSETs by the SJTO
Executive Chair.</p>
<p>I am excited about the advantages for parents and school boards that the ties with
HRTO and other SJTO tribunals provide. Applications regarding the provision of
special education arise frequently at HRTO, and we are building a dedicated group
of adjudicators with expertise in the resolution of these cases, and others involving
children, across the tribunals. These changes will enhance the ability of our
stakeholders to have their disputes involving special education services resolved in
a manner tailored to the nature of the dispute, by adjudicators with expertise in the
substance of special education and dispute resolution in this context.</p>
<p>The Ontario Special Education (French) Tribunal is an important institution for
franco-Ontarians and Ontario's French-language education system. We are
committed to ensuring the highest quality of French-language services for
individuals for francophone stakeholders when they bring a dispute about special
education before the Tribunal.</p>
<p>I am proud of the strong foundation that previous chairs, vice-chairs and members
of the OSETs have established for mediating and adjudicating special education
disputes. I look forward to hearing feedback from those who use our services as
we now work to continue to improve our services with the resources and expertise
available in SJTO.</p>

<h3 id="oset-2">Legislative Authority</h3>
<p>The legislative mandate of the OSETs is found in section 57 of the <em>Education Act,
R.S.O. 1990</em>, c. E. 2. Their primary role is to adjudicate appeals initiated by parents
regarding identification and/or placement decisions made by school boards with
respect to students with special needs (exceptional pupils), and to make decisions
that are in the best interest of these pupils.</p>
<p>The Ontario Special Education (English) Tribunal hears appeals for students
enrolled in the 60 English-language school boards, both public and Roman
Catholic. Le Tribunal de l'enfance en difficult&eacute; de l'Ontario (franÃ§ais) hears appeals
for students enrolled in 12 French-language school boards, both public and Roman
Catholic.</p>
<p>OSET is an appeal tribunal. OSET appellants must first have satisfied the
prerequisites set out in the <em>Education Act</em> and its <em>Regulations</em>, before they are
legally entitled to appeal.</p>

<h3 id="oset-3">Operational Highlights</h3>
<h4>Adjudication</h4>
<p>The current fiscal year opened with one case on the register of the English
Tribunal, and two additional appeals were initiated during the year. Of these, one
appeal was withdrawn following mediation, one appeal was closed by a
Supplementary Decision. At fiscal year-end, OSET had one open case.</p>
<p>There were no appeals filed, and no open cases, with the French Tribunal.</p>

<h2 id="sbt">SOCIAL BENEFITS TRIBUNAL</h2>

<h3 id="sbt-1">Associate Chair's Message</h3>
<div class="box"><strong>Beverly Moore, Interim Associate Chair</strong>
<br><em>Social Benefits Tribunal</em></div>
<br>

<p>The past year at the Social Benefits Tribunal (SBT) has been one of change and
opportunity. The former Associate Chair Gary Yee left in August of 2012. The
tribunal has continued the good work that he began in improving scheduling,
consistency and accountability.</p>
<p>In late 2012, the SBT began to have its decisions available on the website of the
Canadian Legal Information Institute â€“ <a href="http://www.canlii.org/" target="_blank">www.canlii.org</a>. The accessibility of a
tribunal's decisions is an essential element in public accountability and consistency
of the tribunal. As well as the public posting of decisions, SBT implemented a new
electronic decision system that has improved the time from hearing to a decision
being released. These significant improvements garnered recognition for
innovation through the Excelsior Award program, an awards program within the
Ministry of the Attorney General.</p>
<p>SBT faced a significant increase in appeals in late 2011. Due to the increase in
appeals, the wait time to hearings increased. The tribunal took a number of steps
to manage this increase. Some of the initiatives include increasing the number of
hearings, early resolution sessions for appropriate appeals and recruitment for
additional adjudicators. The tribunal continues to take the steps necessary for
active adjudication to ensure the timeliness and efficiency of hearings, while still
ensuring accessibility and natural justice.</p>
<p>Our strong working relationships with stakeholders has resulted in constructive
discussions on how we can all improve in ensuring fair and timely processes with
the resources available. We appreciate the contributions and feedback of our
stakeholders.</p>
<p>The benefit of being within SJTO has been demonstrated by the crossappointment
of adjudicators, increasing our hearing capacity and building our
expertise in subject areas such as the <em>Human Rights Code</em>.</p>
<p>I take great pride in the work of SBT's members and staff, who ensure that we
provide fair and accessible dispute resolution. Thanks to their joint commitment
and dedication, SBT is meeting the workload challenges. We look forward to the
opportunities to build on our success in the coming fiscal year.</p>

<h3 id="sbt-2">Legislative Authority</h3>
<p>The SBT was established in 1998 under Part IV of the Ontario Works Act, 1997.
Appeals are heard under that act and the <em>Ontario Disability Support Program Act,
1997</em>. The SBT considers appeals by individuals who have been refused social
assistance and recipients of social assistance who disagree with a decision that
affects the amount of or their eligibility for social assistance.</p>
<p>The SBT conducts hearings throughout Ontario. Because of the sensitive personal
information involved in these cases, the legislation requires that all hearings must
be held in private.</p>

<h3 id="sbt-3">Operational Highlights</h3>
<h4>Caseload</h4>
<p>In the first nine months of the 2012-2013 fiscal year, the SBT experienced a 33 per
cent increase in appeals compared to the same period in the previous year. The
increase in appeals eventually levelled off as the year progressed. By the end of
the fiscal year 2012-2013, the SBT received 15,430 appeals â€“ an increase of
approximately 15 per cent (1,995 appeals) compared to the previous fiscal year.</p>

<h4>Early Resolution Program</h4>
<p>The Early Resolution Program (ERP) continues to grow as a valuable component
of our overall case management program. In the last fiscal year, SBT conducted
over 1,080 Early Resolution Sessions. This was more than triple the number of
Early Resolution Sessions conducted the previous year. With the increase in
appeals this year, the ERP continues to become a valuable and effective
mechanism for achieving a fair and efficient resolution without the need for a
hearing to be scheduled.</p>
<p>The ERP process usually involves a telephone call between the two parties and
the Tribunal's Appeal Resolution Officer (ARO), who acts as a facilitator to discuss
possible ways to resolve the appeal without the need for a full hearing. The
Tribunal has a Practice Direction for the ERP, as well as a Practice Tips document,
which are publicly available on our website.</p>

<h4>Communication and Stakeholder Engagement</h4>
<p>The SBT continued its commitment to communicate effectively with its
stakeholders, which is an essential component of ensuring accountability and
transparency. During this fiscal year, the SBT held two meetings of its Consultative
Committee and in March of 2013 we conducted our first videoconference
demonstration for our stakeholders. Participants were able to see the technology
in action, ask questions, and take part in a mock hearing done in real time between
Timmins and Toronto. Using feedback from the stakeholders, SBT created a
videoconferencing tip sheet for all participants.</p>

<h3 id="sbt-4">Statistics/Commentary</h3>
<p>The SBT completed 13,325 appeals, which was an increase of over 500 from the
previous year, but the SBT's pending inventory still increased by over 2,100 cases,
due to the significant increase in appeals. The overall average case processing
time decreased from 9.2 months to 8.7 months.</p>
